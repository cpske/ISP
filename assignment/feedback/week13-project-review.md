## Feedback from TAs on Projects

The TAs reported several common problems in projects.

Please work seriously to improve anything the TAs mentioned to you,
especially these areas:

1. Not doing Pull Request reviews, and making meaningful comments in Github 
   - should spend time to do a **serious** review and make suggestions
   - if you don't comment, how do you know the PR was reviewed?

2. Little or no unit testing
   - you should spend as much time writing tests as writing code
   - this will hurt your project score, too

3. Code quality

4. Sprint Retrospectives not done

5. Mixing up "goals" and "milestones".

6. Put off C.I. to the last iteration.  C.I. should be started as early as possible.  
   - Travis CI and Circle CI are good choices and easy to setup.

7. Not merging completed code from "feature" branch into master.

8. No Standup meetings
