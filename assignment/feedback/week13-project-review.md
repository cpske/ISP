## Feedback from TAs on Projects

The TAs reported several common deficiencies in projects.

Please work seriously to improve anything the TAs mentioned to you,
especially these areas:

1. Not doing Pull Request reviews, and making meaningful comments in Github 
   - should spend time to do a serious review and make suggestions
   - if you don't comment, how do you know the PR was reviewed?

2. Code quality

3. Sprint Retrospectives not done

4. No Standup meetings

5. Little or no unit testing
   - you should spend as much time writing tests as writing code
   - this will hurt your project score, too

6. Put off C.I. to the last iteration.  That's not useful.

7. Not merging completed code from "feature" branch into master.
