title: Refactoring

> Knowing the refactorings will help you write better code even **before** your refactor.   
> These refactorings may be on a quiz or exam.

1. Study Refactoring techniques and signs (*aka* "Code Smells").  You should know the names of several common refactorings.
   - See [Refactoring](/ISP/refactoring/) for some sites to read (listed at end of page)
   - [Refactoring Techniques](https://refactoring.guru/techniques) on  [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is good, but some examples are trivial.
   - Or, find your own refactoring site. Please send me link(s) to any sites you recommend to others, or post links on Google Classroom.
   - Study all 6 categories of refactoring (as on Refactoring Guri).

2. Find a good refactoring example in your code or some student code on Github, preferrably:
   - your own PA4 project from Programming2
   - someone else's project from Programming2
   - your current team project
   - another team's project
3. Please **don't use** (only) these refactoring we've already covered many times:
   - rename variable or method
   - extract method
   - introduce explanatory variable
   - replace magic number (or other literal) with named constant
   - replace type code or "switch" with strategy

4. Describe the refactoring in a personal Github repo named "refactoring"
   - if you already have a "refactoring" repo, then rename it to something else using Github repo Settings page
   - in your repo provide:
     1. README.md  describe the refactoring.
     2. README should contain links to the repository and code you refer to in your example
     3. (optional) include source code files used in the refactoring repo. You might include the "after refactoring" version of a file.
     4. Use good Markdown formatting and good English.  Use literal formatting only for code or program output.
