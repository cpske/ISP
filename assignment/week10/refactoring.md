title: Refactoring 
---

1. Study Refactoring techniques and signs (*aka* "Code Smells").  You should know the names of several common refactorings.
   - See [Refactoring](/ISP/refactoring/) for some sites to read (listed at end of page)
   - [Refactoring Techniques](https://refactoring.guru/techniques) on  [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is good, but some examples are trivial.
   - Or, find your own refactoring site. Please send me link(s) to any sites you recommend to others, or post links on Google Classroom.

> Knowing the refactorings will help you write better code even **before** your refactor.   
> These refactorings may be on a quiz or exam.

2. Find a good refactoring in your code or some student code on Github, preferrably:
   - your own PA4 project from Programming2
   - someone else's project from Programming2
   - your current team project
   - another team's project
  Please don't use these refactoring we've already covered many times:
   - rename variable or method
   - extract method
   - introduce explanatory variable
   - replace magic number (or other literal) with named constant
   - replace type code or "switch" with strategy

3. Write your refactoring in a personal Github repo named "refactoring"
   - if you already have a "refactoring" repo than rename it to something else in Github repo Settings page
   - in your repo provide:
     1. README.md  describes the refactoring.
     2. README should contain links to the repository you are referring to in your example
     3. (optional) include source code files for the refactoring
