```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, 
                 address_line1, address_line2, 
                 subdistrict, district, province, postalCode):
        self.first_name = firstName
        self.last_name = lastName
        self.address_line1 = address_line1
        self.address_line2 = address_line2
        self.subdistrict = subdistrict
        self.district = district
        self.province = province
        self.postal_code = postalCode


```

1. What is (are) sign(s) that this code needs to be refactored?

2. What refactoring would you suggest?
