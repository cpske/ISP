title: Agile Development Questions
---

There is a lot of incorrect information about "Agile" on the web.
The first part of this assignment is to identify some errors in
junk on the web.  It includes junk from respected sites like Infoworld.

You need to think critically to spot some errors.  A critical
thinker could spot some of them without even knowing what Agile is!

For Questions 1-2, read [What is Agile?](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) on AgileAlliance.org, written by the inventors of Agile. Contrast that to these articles:

1. "What is Agile?" on Cprime: https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/
   - The first paragraph contains contains 2 false statements.  
   - What are they?  Why are they false?

2. "What is agile methodology?" on Infoworld: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3237508/what-is-agile-methodology-modern-software-development-explained.html
   - Compare what is written here to https://agilealliance.org/agile101/.
   - How does his usage  of "Agile methodology" *contradict* what is on agilealliance.org?
   - What else in the article is incorrect or contradicts what is on AgileAlliance.org?

Please read these Tips from the book *Practices of an Agile Developer*. Each one is 3-4 pages:
   - Tip 2. Quick Fixes Become Quicksand
   - Tip 8. Question Until You Understand
   - Tip 25. Program Intently and Expressively
   - Tip 26. Communicate in Code
   - Tip 28. Code in Increments
   - Tip 30. Write Cohesive Code

These Tips are used in the Google form for this week's assignment, and will be used next week in doing code improvement.
