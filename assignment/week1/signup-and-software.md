1. Join Google Classroom for "219245 ISP (2020)". Class code: **3blhnrs**
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: https://forms.gle/fh9SqvmA9yPh1ur6A
    - After you submit the form, you'll receive an email invitation to join Github organization "ISP2020". Please join. The email is sent manually, so please be patient.
3. Make sure your Github profile includes a photo that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and real name - at least first name - correctly capitalized.  
4. Include a photo that clearly shows your face in your Google profile, too.

### Software

Please verify you have the following software:

1. Python 3.6 or newer. Python 3.7 or 3.8 preferred.
2. Git including `git` command line client
3. Java Development Kit version 8 or 11
4. An IDE for coding in Python and Java
5. A good text editor. Something better than Notepad. An IDE can edit plain text files, but its cumbersome to start an IDE just to edit a file.
   * Many good text editors are language-aware; they perform highlighting and auto-formatting based on language (including Markdown).  This helps productivity.
