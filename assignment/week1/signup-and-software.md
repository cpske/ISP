4. Update your Github profile, include (a) **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space), (b) your **real name** correctly capitalized -- either first name only or first and last name.  Not a nickname, Not your github login unless it's your real name.
5. Install the **required software**, if you don't have them:
   1. Git including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
   2. Python 3.8 or newer.
   3. IDE for Python:  PyCharm, PyDev (Eclipse), and VS Code are good.
   4. A good text editor. Good text editors do syntax highlighting and formatting to improve your productivity. 
      - popular editors: Atom, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code (a bit slow), TextMate (Mac only).  Terminal (shell) based editors: nano and vim (hard to learn).
      - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.
