1. Join Google Classroom for "219245 ISP (2020)". Class code: **3blhnrs**
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: https://forms.gle/fh9SqvmA9yPh1ur6A
3. Verify your Github profile includes (a) a **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and (b) your **real name** correctly capitalized -- first name only or first and last name are OK.  
4. Include a photo that clearly shows your face in your Google profile, too.

### Software

You need the following software on your computer:

1. Git including `git` command line client
2. Python 3.8 or newer.
3. Java Development Kit version 11 or newer
4. An IDE for coding in Python and Java
5. A good text editor. Something better than Notepad. An IDE can edit plain text files, but its slow to start an IDE just to edit a file.
   * Many good text editors are language-aware; they perform syntax highlighting and auto-format based on language (including Markdown).  This helps productivity.
