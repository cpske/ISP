1. Join [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) for "219245 ISP (2021)". Use class code [ka25cph][classroom-invite] (or just click this link)
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: <https://forms.gle/UP9owsjtYNZtZ1wN6>
3. Tell us your Online Learning preferences: <https://forms.gle/VkG5MBPjgmxRX1xi7>
4. Update your Github profile to include (a) a **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and (b) your **real name** correctly capitalized -- either first name only or first and last name. Use your real name, not a nickname.  
5. Install the required software, if you don't have them:
   1. Git including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
   2. Python 3.8 or newer.
   3. IDE for coding in Python. Pycharm, PyDev (Eclipse), and VS Code are popular.
   4. A good text editor. Good text editors perform syntax highlighting and formatting. This improves your productivity. 
      - popular editors: Atom, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code (a bit slow), TextMate (Mac only).  Terminal (shell) based editors: nano and vim (hard to learn).
      - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.
      - An IDE can edit text files, but IDE is slow to start.
