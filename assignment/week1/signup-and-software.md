1. Join Google Classroom for "219245 ISP (2021)". Class code: **ka25cph**
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: https://forms.gle/UP9owsjtYNZtZ1wN6
3. Update your Github profile to include (a) a **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and (b) your **real name** correctly capitalized -- either first name only or first and last name. Use your real name, not a nickname.  

### Software

You need the following software on your computer:

1. Git including the `git` command line client
2. Python 3.8 or newer.
3. An IDE for coding in Python.
4. A good text editor. Something better than Notepad. An IDE can edit plain text files, but its slow to start an IDE just to edit a file.
   * Good text editors are "language-aware", they perform syntax highlighting and formating based on language (including Markdown).  This helps productivity.
   * Some popular programming editors: Atom, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code (a bit slow), TextMate (Mac only)
