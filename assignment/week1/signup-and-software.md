Please do this before the first week ISP lab.

### 1. Sign-up

[google-classroom]: https://classroom.google.com/c/NjkxNTc2NDc5NzM4
[discord-invite]: https://discord.gg/jJJGrEJUqB

1. Join the [Google Classroom][google-classroom] for this course. 
2. Tell us your Github id on this form: <https://forms.gle/rbJrt89ar5Swx9VC8>
3. Join our Discord Server. Link announced in class and maybe on [About the Course](../../about) page.

### 2. Update Your Github Profile

Update your Github Profile. Your profile should include 

- **photo** that clearly shows your face. Face should be **at least 40%** of vertical space. No credit if face is not clear, obscured, or too small.
- your **real name**, either full name ("Steve Jobs") or first name only ("Steve") are OK. Use **correct capitalization** with space (not "steve jobs" or "SteveJobs").
- Not a nickname. Not your Github login.

See examples below.

### 3. Install or Upgrade Required Software 

Install this **required software**, if you don't have them:

- **Git** including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
- Python 3.11 or newer. Python 3.11 is recommended.
- IDE for Python.  [PyCharm][], [PyDev][] (Eclipse), and [VS Code][vscode] are good.
- [OBS Studio][obsproject], to record your computer screen during coding tests.
- A good **text editor** with syntax highlighting, for situations where you want to edit a single text file.
  - Good editors: [Atom][], [Notepad++][] (Windows), [Sublime][], [VS Code][vscode] (a bit slow), [TextMate][] (Mac), or [vim][] (a bit hard to learn).
  - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.
