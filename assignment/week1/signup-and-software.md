1. Join [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) for "219245 ISP (2022)". Use class code [r3466kb][classroom-invite].
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: <https://forms.gle/UP9owsjtYNZtZ1wN6>
3. Update your Github profile, include 
   - **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space)
   - your **real name** correctly capitalized -- first name only or first and last name are OK.  Not a nickname; Not your Github login.
4. Install the **required software**, if you don't have them:
   1. Git including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
   2. Python 3.8 or newer.
   3. IDE for Python.  [PyCharm][], [PyDev][] (Eclipse), and [VS Code][vscode] are good.
   4. A good text editor that does syntax highlighting, for situations where you need to edit a single file.
      - Popular editors: [Atom][], [Notepad++][], [Sublime][], [VS Code][vscode] (a bit slow), [TextMate][] (Mac)
      - Terminal-based editors: [nano][] and [vim][] (hard to learn)
      - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.
