1. Join Google Classroom for "219245 ISP (2020)". Class code: **3blhnrs**
2. Join Github Organization "ISP2020".
3. Make sure your Github profile includes a photo that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and real name - at least first name - correctly capitalized.  
4. Include a photo that clearly shows your face in your Google profile, too.

### Software

Please verify you have the following software:

1. Python 3.6 or newer. Python 3.7 or 3.8 preferred.
2. Git including `git` command line client
3. Java Development Kit version 8 or 11
4. An IDE for coding in Python and Java
5. A good text editor. Something better than Notepad. An IDE can edit plain text files, but its cumbersome to start an IDE just to edit a file.
   * Many good text editors are language-aware; they perform highlighting and auto-formatting based on language (including Markdown).  This helps productivity.
