Please do this before the first week ISP lab:


1. Join the [Google Classroom][google-classroom-invite] for this course. Class code is **5zjkval**.
2. Tell us your Github id on this form: <https://forms.gle/QK36o6ky1D85KLsN7>
3. Update your Github Profile. Please include 
   - **photo** that clearly shows your face. Face should be at least 50% of vertical space.
   - your **real name** correctly **capitalized** ("Steve Jobs") -- first name only ("Steve") or first and last name ("Steve Jobs") are OK.  
   - Not a nickname; Not your Github login.
4. Join our [Discord Server][discord-invite].
5. Install this **required software**, if you don't have them:
   - **Git** including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
   - Python 3.9 or newer.
   - IDE for Python.  [PyCharm][], [PyDev][] (Eclipse), and [VS Code][vscode] are good.
   - [OBS Studio][obsproject], to record your computer screen during coding tests.
   - A good **text editor** with syntax highlighting, for situations where you want to edit a single text file.
     - Good editors: [Atom][], [Notepad++][] (Windows), [Sublime][], [VS Code][vscode] (a bit slow), [TextMate][] (Mac), or [vim][] (hard to learn).
     - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.
