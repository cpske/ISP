1. Join [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) for "219245 ISP (2021)". Use class code [ka25cph][classroom-invite] (or just click [this link][classroom-invite])
2. Tell us your Github login on this form: <https://forms.gle/UP9owsjtYNZtZ1wN6>
3. Tell us your Online Learning preferences: <https://forms.gle/VkG5MBPjgmxRX1xi7>
4. Update your Github profile, include (a) **photo** that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space), (b) your **real name** correctly capitalized -- either first name only or first and last name.  Not a nickname; Not your github login unless it's your real name.
5. Install the **required software**, if you don't have them:
   1. Git including the `git` command. Download from <https://git-scm.com>
   2. Python 3.8 or newer.
   3. IDE for Python:  [PyCharm][], [PyDev][] (Eclipse), and [VS Code][vscode] are good.
   4. A good text editor that does syntax highlighting and formatting to improve your productivity. 
      - Popular editors: [Atom][], [Notepad++][], [Sublime][], [VS Code][vscode] (a bit slow), [TextMate][] (Mac only)
      - Terminal (shell) based editors: [nano][] and [vim][] (hard to learn)
      - Windows Notepad is NOT a good editor.

### Examples of Good Github Profiles

Your Github account is part of your resume.  Make it look professional!

Include at least

1. Real name, first name only or first and last
2. Photo that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space)
3. Brief description of you. What are your software-related interests?
