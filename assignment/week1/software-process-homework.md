### Description

**Read** one of the book chapters below (your choice),
then answer the online questions about software process.
Both of these contain a good general description of software process.

* [Software Processes - Summerville, Chapter 2][summerville] from *Software Engineering*, 9E, by Ian Summerville.
  - short, concise description of software process models and activities

or this (has more detail than the above):

* [Software Life-Cycle Models (ch. 2) and Software Processes (ch. 3)][schach] from *Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engeering*, 8E, by William Schach.
  - chapter 2 contains most of what you need to know
  - chapter 3 describes "workflows" in a software process, using the Unified Process (UP) as a model
  - **more detail** than Summerville's chapter


### Assignment

Online questions are posted on Google Classroom, as a Google Form.


### Resources to Learn More

A good, free online course about Software Process fundamentals is

* [Software Development Processes and Methodologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-processes/), U. of Minnesota on Coursera.  A good overview course for the activities in a software process. Good advise on developer habits.
 * This course is part of a 4-course series by U.M. that looks interesting.

[Process Models][pressman], chapter 2 from Pressman *Software Engineering: A Practioner's Approach*, 7E, is a slightly more abstract introduction to software processes. Worth reading 

[Managing the Development of Large Software Systems][royce] by Winston Royce, the original article describing the waterfall model. Royce didn't call it "waterfall"! This classic paper is very short.  If you read it, you'll see that most people *don't* understand Royce's model.
