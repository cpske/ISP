### Description

Read one of the book chapters below,
then answer the online questions about software process.

These are chapters from 2 standard textbooks on Software Engineering.
Both of them contain good general descriptions of software process.

* [Software Processes - Summerville, Chapter 2][summerville] from *Software Engineering*, 9E, by Ian Summerville.
  - simple, concise description of software process models and activities

If you want more detail than Summerville's explanation, then please have a look at this:
* [Software Life-Cycle Models (ch. 2) and Software Processes (ch. 3)][schach] from *Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engeering*, 8E, by William Schach.
  - chapter 2 contains most of what you need to know
  - chapter 3 describes the "workflows" in a software process, using the UP as a model

If you reed both, please let me know which one you think is a better introduction for next year's ISP class to read! 

### Assignment

Online questions to be added.

### Resources

A good, free online course about Software Process fundamentals is
[Software Development Processes and Methodologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-processes/), U. of Minnesota on Coursera.  A good overview course for the activities in a software process. Some good advise on developer habits.
 * This course is part of a 4-course series by U.M. that looks interesting.

Pressman, Chapter 2 [Process Models][pressman] is a slightly more abstract introduction to software processes, from *Software Engineering: A Practioner's Approach*, 7E, a well-known book by William Pressman.

Winston Royce, [Managing the Development of Large Software Systems][royce], the original article describing the waterfall model (Royce didn't call it that). This classic paper is very short.
