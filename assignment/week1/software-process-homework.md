title: Software Process Homework
---

### Description

**Read** about Software Process in either of the books below (your choice),
then answer the online questions about software process.
Both of these contain a good general description of software process.

* [Software Processes - Summerville, Chapter 2][summerville] from *Software Engineering*, 9E, by Ian Summerville.
  - short, concise description of software process models and activities
  - the PDF includes Chapters 1 - 3 for those interested in learning more about Software Engineering. You only need Chapter 2 to answer the questions.

or this (has more detail):

* [Software Life-Cycle Models (ch. 2) and Software Processes (ch. 3)][schach] from *Object-Oriented and Classical Software Engeering*, 8E, by William Schach.
  - chapter 2 contains most of what you need to know
  - chapter 3 describes "workflows" in a software process, using the Unified Process (UP) as a model

### Resources to Learn More

* [Process Models][pressman], chapter 2 from Pressman *Software Engineering: A Practioner's Approach*, 7E, a slightly more abstract introduction to software processes than Schach or Summerville's books. Pressman's book is very highly rated.

* [Software Development Processes and Methodologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-processes/), free online course on Coursera.  A good overview of the activities in a software process, by the University of Minnesota. Good advise on developer habits, too.
 * This course is part of a 4-course series by U.M. that looks quite interesting.

* [Managing the Development of Large Software Systems][royce] by Winston Royce (1970).  The original, **classic** article describing the waterfall model -- and very short. Royce didn't call it "waterfall"! When you read it, you'll see that most people *don't* understand Royce's model.
