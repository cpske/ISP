It should be some process you actually do to achieve a specific result.

Write the following:

* Name of the process
* Preconditions, if any
* Activities - brief descriptive names OK
* Tasks within each activity - with description what to do
* Work product - what is the result of the process?
* Evaluation criteria - how is the result evaluated? Be honest, if you have an evaluation criteria it should be something that might cause you to reject the result and do it again.

### Example Processes

* Paint a Room
* Make a [something you create]

You should choose a topic you have actual experience at doing.
