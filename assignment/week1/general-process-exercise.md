### Assignment Description

Create a Google Doc describing the process you use
for some non-software project.  
Submit the Google Doc to the assignment item on Google Classroom.

It should be a process you actually do to achieve a specific result.

Write the following:

* Name of the process
* Preconditions, if any
* Activities - brief descriptive names OK
* Tasks within each activity - with description what to do
* Work product - what is the result of the process?
* Evaluation criteria - how is the result evaluated? Be honest, if you have an evaluation criteria it should be something that might cause you to reject the result and do it again.

Optional:
* If the process has distinct phases, identify them

Evaluation:
* Your process description should be well-formatted, clear, complete, and fit on 1 page.

Examples:
* Wash a Car
* Service a Bicycle (if you actually do this)
  - Honda & Toyota have a **very well defined** process for what to do when they service a car
* Paint a Room
* Make a [*something you create*]

Bad Examples:
* Practice Piano (no specific work product)
* Build a Car (too complex, probably not something any of you do)

* **File Name**: name of the file should be the name of your process
  - Example: `Wash a Car` (for the example process given below)
