## Test Installation of Another Student's django-polls Project

This assignment was given before students added external configuration,
so they may not have instructions for creating a `.env` file.

Please ask the project author for a sample `.env` file or create one yourself --
just look in their `settings.py` for the variables they require.
(You must start by using your own `.env` file.)

1. Test pairings are given below.
   - Use the class scores spreadsheet to find the student's Github ID.
   - The repo will have a URL like `https://github.com/github_id/django-polls/`

2. Clone the repository.

3. Follow instructions as shown on their Github repo README.
    - You may need to add a step to create a `.env` file.

4. Open a Github issue for problems you find. OK to open one issue for several problems or use separate issues.  Look for:
    - anything that doesn't work
    - omitted steps that are needed to run
    - anything not clear in instructions that is important to know
      * does he tell you how to install dependencies?

5. Open separate issue for:
    - spelling, grammar, and formatting errors in README.md
