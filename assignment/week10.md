On your Github project homepage, please provide:

1. Link to your current iteration plan
2. Link to your issue tracker
3. Link to your task board (tasks for current iteration)

Then, add a *link* to your project home on the shared Google sheet [http://bit.ly/isp2018proposals](http://bit.ly/isp2018proposals)

## Iteration Plan

Create a one page plan for the current iteration.

This can be pretty simple but should include:

* **Dates** Start date and end date of iteration
* **Goal(s)** for this iteration.  A "goal" can be descriptive such as
  > Identify most use-cases for game, and record them in project wiki with brief description of each use case.    
* One or more **milestones**. A "milestone" is something concrete, and usually related to running software.  But in first iteration a milestone can be a non-code artifact.
  > * Setup shared git repository with automatic unit testing using Jenkins.    
  > * Create a domain model for quiz game, and produce a working prototype that shows questions.    
* List of **features** to implement. In first iteration, there may not be any.
* **Tasks** recorded on your task board.  If your proposal mentions using Scrum, then tasks must have time estimates.
