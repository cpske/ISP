## Minimal requirements for Project Github

The project README should include a description of the project 
and links to other important information.  

In your Github project README, please include:

1. Link to your current iteration plan
2. Link to your issue tracker
3. Link to your task board (tasks for current iteration)

Of course, you can also have links to other items, such as link to design
documents, installation guide, or your CI server.

Here is a [nice project homepage](https://github.com/SSD2015/TeamGG) from Software Spec & Design course. Your homepage content will be **different** from this. 

## Iteration Plan

Create a one page plan for the current iteration.

This can be pretty simple but should include:

* **Dates** Start date and end date of iteration
* **Goal(s)** for this iteration.  A "goal" can be descriptive such as
  > Identify most use-cases for game, and record them in project wiki with brief description of each use case.    
* One or more **milestones**. A "milestone" is something concrete, and usually related to running software.  But in first iteration a milestone can be a non-code artifact.
  > * Setup shared git repository with automatic unit testing using Jenkins.    
  > * Create a domain model for quiz game, and produce a working prototype that shows questions from a database.    
* List of **features** to implement. In the first iteration, there may not be any.
* **Tasks** recorded on your task board.  If your team is using Scrum, then tasks must have time estimates.
