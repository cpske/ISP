## Code Review

1. Read Code Review best practices 
2. Study some example checklists and "script".
2. Write your own script or procedure for your team project.
3. Write your own code review checklist.


### 1. Read Code Review best practices

1.1 Read these Code Review Best Practices

* SmartBear: https://www.kessler.de/prd/smartbear/BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf
* Perforce: https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-code-review-best-practices
* JetBrains: https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2018/08/30/code-review-best-practices/

1.2 Which best practices wil you apply to your project? List them.

### 2. Study some example checklists and Script/Procedure

2.1 Study the example checklists and script from these sources:

* PSP (look for "Code Review") https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/PSP-Review-Script-Checklist.pdf
* Java https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/Java-Code-Review-Checklist.pdf

2.2 Try to find another example checklist that you think is useful.

### 3. Create your own Code Review Procedure

* The procedure is for in-person reviews, but helpful if it also applies to remote reviews like Desk Check
* The procedure should have at least these sections:
   - before review (preconditions or "Entry Conditions")
   - during review
   - after review
   - closure or "Exit Conditions"

### 4. Create your own Code Review Checklist

* Make it short, concise, and specific
* Group items into categories. You use the categories to count defects.
* Write what is actually useful to look for
* Checklist should evolve with use -- remove items, add items, refine items

## How and Where to Submit

Record the procedure (script) and checklist with your project documentation and provide a **link** in your project's README.  They should be separate documents.

Grading:

1. Use of good English.
2. Clarity and preciseness.
3. Consistency.
4. Uniqueness of items - two items don't state same thing.
