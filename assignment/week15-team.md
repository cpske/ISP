## Team Assignment for Nov 25 - Dec 5

1. Complete or improve all **past work** that got less than perfect score.

2. Create a thorough **End-to-End test** using Selenium.
   * Must test many features of your app using Selenium to control browser.
   * Use the most important features, including input and search.
   * E2E test must detect and report problems.
   * Not required to test everything.  Not required to automate E2E test.

3. Add code coverage, if you haven't done it already.
   * Coverage report should be visible on Github or add a link in README.md.

4. Prepare a 15 minute presentation for Dec 6.

   * Describe your process, process improvements, and lessons learned
   * Describe interesting technology you learned and used
   * Briefly describe what the application does, and anything not yet done
   * Don't demo the application -- the students will try it themselves
   * Challenge or Game: if you can create a short "challenge" for everyone using your app, that's good.
       - Example: find the fastest recipe involving rice and tomato that has a user rating of at least 4.0


## Process Artifacts Your Project Should Have

1. Complete, well-written **iteration plans**.
   * has an "objective" or "goal" in each iteration
   * has one or more concrete, verifiable milestones in each iteration
   * has list of major work items (broken down into tasks in your task board)
2. Summary of **retrospectives** (Scrum)
   * For every team that said they were using Scrum in their proposal
   * On Github Wiki or Google docs, with a link in README.md
3. **Task board** with...
   * Almost all tasks for all iterations, including unplanned work
   * Tasks contain person who did them and time spent
   * Tasks should be specific and concrete, esp. after 1st iteration
4. **Issues** - work items, requests, and bugs
   * Issues should be specific and clear
5. Github repository with branches, pull requests, pull request comments 
6. CI environment with useful test results
   * You must have good and sufficient tests for results to be useful
   * You should merge tests into `master` when you merge the dev branches.
7. **Code coverage reports**, either on Github or in CI
