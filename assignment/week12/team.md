## Team Assignment

On your Github project homepage, please include:

1. Link to your **up to date** iteration plans 
    - Iteration plans must either be in Github project Wiki (recommended) or a shared Google doc
2. Link to your task board, showing tasks for current iteration
    - Tasks must have required info below
3. Link to your project documentation


### Iteration Plan

Create a plan for the current iteration, and do it for all future iterations.

Each Iteration Plan includes:

* **Dates** Start date and end date of iteration
* **Goal(s)** for this iteration.  A "goal" can be descriptive such as
  > Identify most use-cases, and record them in project wiki with brief description of each use case.    
  > Implement "play game" use case for demo user
* **Milestone(s)**. 
]   * A "milestone" is something concrete and verifiable ("its been done").
    * Milestones usually related to running software (not documents).  But in first 1-2 iterations a milestone can be a non-code artifact.
    * "Learn to use xxx" is **not** a milestone.
    * Some early iteration milestones:
    > Setup shared git repository with automatic unit testing using Jenkins.    
    > Create a domain model for game, and produce a working prototype that shows questions.       
    > This is only a "milestone" if you create a good, *written* domain model and capture it online.   
* List of **features** to implement in this iteration and **major tasks**. In first iteration, there may not be any features.
* **Summary** of Retrospective.
    * Record import results of iteration.
    * Note which features, tasks, milestones you **didn't** achieve, and why.
    * No plan is perfect. Expect to "miss" milestone and goals, and be honest about it.

### Iteration "Script" - How to Do Iteration

This is based on typical Agile project workflow.
Use it to get started, and customize to suit your team process.

<td align="left" markdown="span">
1. Review results of previous iteration. 
    - Any unfinished work from last iteration?  Add it to project backlog.
    - Any new work you discovered? Add that to project backlog, too.
    - Any major problems or risks you should address?  How?
2. Decide on...
    - major work to do this iteration
    - goal(s)
    - milestones - markers that demonstrate real progress
    - Get help with issues you don't know how to solve (TA/instructor)
3. Revise or write current iteraion plan in Wiki or Google docs.
4. Plan the work!
    - update your domain model or user-interaction model
    - decide on tasks and add them to Task Board as backlog
    - annotate tasks: a) write detailed description or steps, b) estimate time
