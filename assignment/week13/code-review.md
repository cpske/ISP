title: Code Review Assignment
---

This is a team assignment, but **everyone** should do the reading and study. 

1. Read Code Review best practices 
2. Write your own code review procedure.
3. Study some example checklists and "scripts".
4. Write your own code review checklist.

### 1. Read Code Review Best Practices

1.1 Read these Code Review Best Practices (they are short).

* SmartBear: <https://www.kessler.de/prd/smartbear/BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf>
* Perforce: <https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-code-review-best-practices>
* JetBrains: <https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2018/08/30/code-review-best-practices/>

1.2 Which best practices will you apply to your project?  Choose the ones that are practical and useful. List them.

### 2. Create your own Code Review Procedure

Create a procedure or "script" for how you will do group code "walk-through".
The procedure is like a plan for how to do them, including:

Before:

1. What is the **goal** of your code review?
2. How to you schedule a code review?  How long?
3. What do the articles (above) recommend you do **before** a code review?
   - Which of them make sense for your team? (Don't try to be too complex.)

During:

- What should you do during the code review?
- Who does what?
- Be specific

After:

- What should be done after the code review?  Who does it?

### 3. Checklist Examples

A checklist reminds you what you should check during a group code review, walk-through, or individual review (reviewing a Pull Request or your own code!).

It should be practical & short.  You should **update it** as you get better at doing reviews.

Some examples (please don't copy them!):

- [Vacseen Project Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJqZ3WlXeycAEXh6zB1JEkJHjNAY0ihp8oIT0eFlDfk/edit) (2019)
- [KooCook Project Script & Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSI0FGx4NZyqwAVUOYt641X0tsdqfeRz3O-R3XnfGFE/edit) (2019)
- [KU Event Regis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pRlqTeCQEq9T0g3NPf8yt26aUKCSKC3rqEyI3L4xy_I/edit#heading=h.imm89g97i44a) (2019)
- [Real Estate Rental](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plSBYDK-mYTJ-u1JY7BV-esmCcP8XGtpmY4gUwgzB0g/edit) (2020)

Poor Examples:

- [2019 Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yKp1QEeML1Y40vKWtDQXcF1b86ywMhAMUPt1jFsnZ90/edit) - some items are OK but most are too general and vague. "Refactor", "Check logic of the function", "Test quality", "Check line-by-line code" (generic) are not helpful guidance.
- [2020 Project](https://github.com/Jomsaruj/DEK-COM/wiki/Code%20Review%20Checklist) most things don't apply to code review. It is more like an "agile project checklist".

These checklists are good for ideas but they are too long, and some parts don't apply to your projects:

- PSP <https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/PSP-Review-Script-Checklist.pdf>
- Java <https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/Java-Code-Review-Checklist.pdf>


### 4. Create a Code Review Checklist

It should be things you should do or should review during a group review (walk-through or code review) or individually (reviewing a Pull Request or your own code).

- It should be things **that apply to your project**
- You should **update it** for problems you find during code review
  - remove items, add items, refine items
- Write what you find useful to look for
- Make it short and helpful
- **No B.S.** copied from examples. 
- Group items into categories so its easier to check them.

## Where to Submit

Write the checklist and procedure (or script) in your project wiki and provide **link(s)** in the main landing page of your project "information hub" (for most teams, this is the wiki).

## Grading Criteria

1. Use of good English.
2. Clarity and consistency.
3. Applies to your project and shows some thought. Not copied from examples.
   - No nonsense or stuff you don't actually do.
4. Uniqueness of items - two items don't cover the same thing.
5. Make use of automation tools. If something can be checked using a tool then do that instead of doing it via manual review.
