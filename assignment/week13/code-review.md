title: Code Review Assignment
---

This is a team assignment, but **everyone** should do the reading and study. 

1. Read Code Review best practices 
2. Study some example checklists and "scripts".
3. Write your own code review procedure for your team project.
4. Write your own code review checklist.

### 1. Read Code Review Best Practices

1.1 Read these Code Review Best Practices. Links and summary are also in my [Code Review](/ISP/code-review/) topic document.

* SmartBear: https://www.kessler.de/prd/smartbear/BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf
* Perforce: https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-code-review-best-practices
* JetBrains: https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2018/08/30/code-review-best-practices/

1.2 Which best practices wil you apply to your project?  List them.

### 2. Create your own Code Review Procedure

* The procedure is for in-person and online peer reviews, but should be helpful for a Desk Check, too.

* The procedure should have these sections, and may have other sections:
   - Precondtions (aka "Entry Conditions"), what to do before review
   - Performing the review
   - After the review - what follow-up or later work is required? 
   - Closure or "Exit Conditions"

* It should be as *short as possible* so people will remember it and use it.

### 3. Create your own Code Review Checklist

* Make it short, concise, and specific to your work

* No B.S. copied from examples. 

* Group items into categories so they are easier to apply.
  - Categories help guide your attention during review.
  - Categories are helpful to count defects
* Write what is actually useful to look for
* Checklist should be updated as you use it -- remove items, add items, refine items

## How and Where to Submit

Write the procedure (script) and checklist in your project wiki and provide a **link** in your project README in a section titled "Code Review". 

## Grading Criteria

1. Use of good English.
2. Clarity and consistency.
3. Applies to your project and shows some thought. Not copied from examples.
4. Uniqueness of items - two items don't cover the same thing.
5. Make use of automation tools. If something can be checked using a tool then do that instead of doing it via manual review.

### Example checklists and Script/Procedure

1. These give ideas but are too long and don't apply to your projects:

* PSP (look for "Code Review") https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/PSP-Review-Script-Checklist.pdf
* Java https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/Java-Code-Review-Checklist.pdf

2. Try to find another example checklist that you think is useful.
