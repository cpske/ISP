### Questions

1. Which of the 6 "Tips" from Practices of an Agile Developer stress writing readable code?  4 points
   - [ ] Quick Fixes Become Quicksand
   - [ ] Question Until You Understand
   - [ ] Program Intently and Expressively
   - [ ] Communicate in Code
   - [ ] Code in Increments
   - [ ] Write Cohesive Code

2. What are 2 things that a *team* can do to avoid code that is littered with quick fixes?  4 points
   - [ ] Require all methods be short (say, at most 20 lines).
   - [ ] Do regular code review.
   - [ ] Use code quality checkers like pylint for Python code.
   - [ ] Use unit testing (with high code coverage).
   - [ ] Use end-to-end tests (functional tests) to verify the application works.

3. What kind of information should you provide in documentation comments (docstring, Javadoc, etc.)?  5 points
   - [ ] The meaning of parameters and the return value.
   - [ ] Why the code is doing a specific computation.
   - [ ] The meaning of local variables.
   - [ ] Preconditions (requirements) and post-conditions (promises) of the method.
   - [ ] Exceptions thrown.
   - [ ] Detailed explanation of what each line of code does.
   - [ ] Purpose of the function or method.

4. What kind of information should you provide in single line comments that are in the method body (// comment in Java, #comment in Python)?  3 points
   - [ ] The meaning of parameters and the return value.
   - [ ] Why the code is doing a specific computation.
   - [ ] The meaning of local variables.
   - [ ] Preconditions (requirements) and post-conditions (promises) of the method.
   - [ ] Exceptions thrown.
   - [ ] Detailed explanation of what each line of code does.
   - [ ] Purpose of the function or method.

5. Explain how the Tip "Code in Increments" can also help you write Cohesive Code (another tip). Please be concise -- a concise one sentence answer is better than a long, imprecise paragraph.  4 points

   - write a 1-2 sentence answer

6. When writing an application in Django (or any web framework), it is tempting to put a lot of logic and code in a "view" method.  For example, first check the user is authenticated, then query the database to find all the information for that user, then select the info that the view wants, sort it, and render it in a template.  What Tip suggests that this is a bad idea?  Why?

7. What properties or principles are being violated by the view described in the previous question?
  - [ ] Low Coupling
  - [ ] Cohesion
  - [ ] Clarity
  - [ ] Single Responsibility
  - [ ] Testability


8. The Tips assigned this week primarily relate to what? Choose one best answer.
  - [ ] Adopt Agile development processes
  - [ ] Code quality and maintainability
  - [ ] Team work and/or iterative development
  - [ ] Testing and Verification
  - [ ] Incremental Development


## Part 2: Find the Tip

9. Many teams have a plan with "Deploy to Heroku" scheduled for the end of November.  Which Tip explains why waiting until the end of the project for this is a bad idea?

10. What reason does the Tip give?

11. When you encounter a problem, you can often find a solution for it on StackOverflow.  You test the solution in some sample code and it works.  So, you use it your code.  Which 2 Tips advise you that you should do something more?
