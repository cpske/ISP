## Software Concepts and Terms 

Refactoring and Design Patterns make use of some important concepts for their rationale and decisions.

Please be sure you understand and can explain each of the terms below.
Use any resources you prefer to learn these terms.

- **Abstraction** is a core OO concept. You will often hear (or read) "*a class's methods should have a consistent level of abstraction*" or "*depend on abstractions, not on concretions*". What does that mean?

- **Cohesion**, in particular, what is called *Functional Cohesion*
  and *Informational [or Communication] Cohesion*. It is not important
  to know the terms "temporal cohesion", "informational cohesion", "sequential cohesion", etc.
  When developers refer to cohesion they usually mean "functional cohesion".

- **Coupling**

- **Encapsulation** and *Data Hiding* (or *Information Hiding*), core concepts in OO programming.

- **Polymorphism**

- **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP), explained as "*A class should have only one reason to change*".  This is one of Robert Martin's SOLID principles for software design.
