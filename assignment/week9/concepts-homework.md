## Software Terms and Concepts to Understand

To understand and apply Refactoring and Design Patterns,
it is important to know some concepts that guide the rationale
and decisions in refactoring and design patterns.

Please be sure you understand and can explain each of these.
You may already know some (or all) of them fairly well.

- **Cohesion**, in particular, what is called *Functional Cohesion*
  and *Informational [or Communication] Cohesion*. It is not important
  to know the terms "temporal cohesion", "informational cohesion", "sequential cohesion", etc.
  In OOP, when developers refer to cohesion they usually mean "functional cohesion".

- **Coupling**

- **Abstraction** is a core O-O concept. You will often hear (or read) "*a class's methods should have a consistent level of abstraction*" or "*depend on abstractions, not on concretions*". What does that mean?

- **Encapsulation** and *Data Hiding* (or *Information Hiding*), core concepts in O-O programming.

- **Polymorphism**

- **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP), explained as "*A class should have only one reason to change*".  This is one of Robert Martin's SOLID principles for software design.

Wikipedia's explanations are not the best, but they are short and have been edited by many experts.  The 

- Wikipedia has pages on [Abstraction][abstraction-wikipedia], [Cohesion][cohesion-wikipedia], [Coupling][coupling-wikipedia], and the [SOLID Principles][solid-wikipedia], including SRP.

- *Classes*, Chapter 10 in *Clean Code* describes Cohesion and SRP, with examples. (16 pages)
