title: Github Flow Practice
---

The purpose is to practice project initialization, Github Flow, and merging with conflicts.  Try to do this without actually talking to each other.    
Do all communication online, like remote programming.

### The Goal

When your are done, "master" on your github repo will contain:

* a `README.md` with **links** to the **5 sections** of the menu. At the bottom of the pages are the names of your team members, 1 name per line.
  - when someone clicks on a link it should go *exactly* to the correct section of the menu file.
* a `Menu.md` file containing **these 5 sections**
  - Breakfast Menu
  - Lunch Menu
  - Dinner Menu
  - Night Food Menu
  - Beverages 

## Assignment

1. Each team of 5 people will contribute to a project on Github.
2. One person (the project lead) creates the project
   * Unzip the starter code into your repo and push it to Github
   * Create a Kanban-style project board
   * Invite team members to join the project (in Settings - Collaborators)
3. Create 5 tasks in the Project Board:
   * Breakfact menu
   * Lunch menu
   * Dinner menu
   * Night Food menu
   * Beverages
4. Each team member take one task, move it to "In progress" and add your name.
5. Create a local **branch** for your work, such as `breakfast-menu`.
6. Edit your menu section in Menu.md, add at least 4 menu items, and push it to Github.
   * Also add a link to your menu section in README.md so someone can click to go to your menu section
   * and add your name to README.md
7. Open a Pull Request.
8. Also look for Pull Requests by others.  Comment on their Pull requests. 
   * Check spelling, capitalization, and formatting.
   * Open Issues if you find any errors that should be fixed.
9. When team agrees with your Pull Request, merge your code into master and push.
   * Be sure to update your copy of `master` first. Someone may have updated origin/master while you were working.
10. Push your branch and master to Github.
