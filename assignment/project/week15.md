1. Complete or improve all **past work** that got less than perfect score.

2. Create a thorough **End-to-End test** using Selenium.
   * Must test many features of your app using Selenium to control browser.
   * Use the most important features, including input and search.
   * E2E test must detect and report problems.
   * Not required to test everything.  Not required to automate E2E test.

3. Add code coverage, if you haven't done it already.
   * Coverage report should be visible on Github or add a link in README.md.

4. Prepare a 15 minute presentation for Dec 6.

   * Describe your process, process improvements, and lessons learned
   * Describe interesting technology you learned and used
   * Briefly describe what the application does, and anything not yet done
   * Don't demo the application -- the students will try it themselves
   * Challenge or Game: if you can create a short "challenge" for everyone using your app, that's good.
