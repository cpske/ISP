Title: Project Review Checklist
---

Things to look for when reviewing project work

### Branches

- [] Branches are features, not long-running branches ("database", "front-end") and not iterations ("week1")
- [] branches eventually merge into master

### Commit frequency & timing

- [] is everyone committing work to Github? (not just 1 or 2 people)
- [] commits throughout the sprint?  Or only on the last day? (bad sign)

### Pull Requests

- [] have PR in each iteration?
- [] *constructive* team comments in PR? 
- [] did team actually review the work? (look at the comments)
- [] many open PR? (this is a bad sign)
- [] no comments on PR? (also a bad sign)

### Iteration Plan

- [] review the plan with team each week
- [] what's the goal?  
- [] is goal clear?  Is it something important to project?
- [] do tasks match the goal?
- [] are tasks complete? (task cover the work needed to achieve the goal)
- [] has team estimated the effort?

### Task Board

- [] do tasks match what's in iteration plan?
- [] is everyone taking tasks?  
- [] can you see who is doing what? (name is added when a task is started)
- [] is task board up-to-date?

### Roadblocks & Technical Help

- [] any problems encountered?
- [] do they need help on something technology related?

### Retrospective

- [] did team do retrospective last week?
- [] what did team discuss in retrospective? (some teams focus only on the project, not on process)
- [] what was the output of retrospective? (should be recorded)
- [] did team change their process based on retrospective?  in what way?

### Work Products

- [] require each team member to answer these... (rotate each week)
- [] what was produced last week?
- [] can you demo it?
- [] can you run the **tests** for the work? (if no tests, that's a defective process)
