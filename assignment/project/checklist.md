Title: Project Review Checklist
---

Things to look for when reviewing project work

### Github Flow

* Branch names are features, not long-running branches ("database", "front-end") and not iterations ("week1")
  - branches should eventually merge into master/main

* Pull Requests:
  - [] do they have in each iteration?
  - [] constructive team comments? did they review the work?
  - [] many open PR? (this is a bad sign)
  - [] no comments on PR? (also a bad sign)
* Commit frequency & timing
  - [] is everyone committing work to github? (not just 1 or 2)

### Iteration Plan

  - [] review plan with team each week
  - [] what's the goal?  
  - [] is goal clear?  Is it something important to project?
  - [] do tasks match the goal?
  - [] are tasks complete? (task cover the work needed to achieve the goal)
  - [] has team estimated effort?

### Task Board

  - [] tasks match what's in iteration plan?
  - [] is everyone taking tasks?  
  - [] can you see who is doing what? (name added when a task is started)
  - [] is task board up-to-date?

### Roadblocks & Technical Help

  - [] any problems encountered?
  - [] do they need help on something technology related?

### Retrospective

  - [] did team do retrospective last week?
  - [] did they make any change to process based on retrospective?
  - [] did they discuss any process improvement? (some teams focus only on the project, not on process)

### Work Products

  - [] what was produced last week?
  - [] can they demo it?
  - [] do they have **tests** for their work?
