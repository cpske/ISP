title: Code Review Assignment
---

1. Read Code Review best practices 
2. Study some example checklists and "script".
3. Write your own script or procedure for your team project.
4. Write your own code review checklist.

### 1. Read Code Review best practices

1.1 Read these Code Review Best Practices

* SmartBear: https://www.kessler.de/prd/smartbear/BestPracticesForPeerCodeReview.pdf
* Perforce: https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-code-review-best-practices
* JetBrains: https://blog.jetbrains.com/upsource/2018/08/30/code-review-best-practices/

1.2 Which best practices wil you apply to your project?  List them.

### 2. Study some example checklists and Script/Procedure

2.1 Study the example checklists and script from these sources:

* PSP (look for "Code Review") https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/PSP-Review-Script-Checklist.pdf
* Java https://cpske.github.io/ISP/code-review/Java-Code-Review-Checklist.pdf

2.2 Try to find another example checklist that you think is useful.

### 3. Create your own Code Review Procedure

* The procedure is for in-person and online peer reviews, but should be helpful for a Desk Check, too

* The procedure should have at least these sections:
   - Precondtions (aka "Entry Conditions") to do before review
   - performing the review
   - after the review - what follow-up or later work is required? 
   - closure or "Exit Conditions"

### 4. Create your own Code Review Checklist

* Make it short, concise, and specific to your work
  - No B.S. copied from the examples

* Group items into categories. 
  - You will use the categories to count defects and help guide your attention during review.
* Write what is actually useful to look for
* Checklist should be updated as you use it -- remove items, add items, refine items

## How and Where to Submit

Record the procedure (script) and checklist with your project documentation and provide a **link** in your project's README.  They should be separate documents.

## Grading Criteria

1. Use of good English.
2. Clarity and consistency.
3. Applies to your project. Shows some thought; not copied from examples.
4. Uniqueness of items - two items don't cover the same thing.
5. Make use of automation tools. If something can be checked using a tool then do that instead of doing it via manual review.
