title: Project Presentations
---

Prepare a 15-30 minute presentation for 30 Nov - 1 Dec.

The presentation should cover these areas:

* What the application does

* Interesting technology, share what you learned with the class

* Your development process as actually used in your project

* Summarize any process improvements you made.  
  - Did you discover any useful software process practices?

* Benefits and things you learned from the project (be honest)

* Time for questions

Some suggestions:

* Consider structuring your presentation as a "story" of your project.

* Don't waste time telling people what they already know.

* If you use PowerPoint, *don't read* the text from your slides. Use slides to visualize & augment, **not duplicate**, your presentation.  

* Let students try it on their own computer while you are presenting,
  so you do not need to demo every feature.

* Don't demo creating a new local account. That's boring.

* Can you create some sort of exercise or "challenge" for everyone to do?  For example:
  - find something on your site, or find some information.
  - find a science-fiction movie with good reviews. Find a story about a particular topic. Find others to play backetball.
