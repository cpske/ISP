title: Project Presentations
---

Prepare a 15-30 minute presentation for Dec 17.

The presentation should cover these areas:

* Your development process as actually used in your project

* Benefits and things you learned from the project

* What the application does, any interesting technology to share

* Allow a few minutes for questions

Some guidance:

* Consider structuring your presentation as a "story" of your project, cast in a way that informative for others.

* Students already know what your application is about overall, so don't waste time explaining that.

* Students can try it on their own computer while you are presenting,
  so you don't need to demo each feature.

* Don't demo creating a new local account.

* A challenge for audience? Can you create some sort of exercise or "challenge" for everyone.  For example:
  - find a recipe involving rice and tomato that has a user rating of at least 4.0
  - find a 1 bedroom apartment near Kasetsart U.  Which one is cheapest? Closest?
