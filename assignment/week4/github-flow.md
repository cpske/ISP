title: Learn Git Branching, Pull Requests, and Github Flow
---

Github Flow is a workflow for projects using Git, 
whether you work alone or on a team.    
Github Flow uses branches and "pull requests", 
so you need to understand those, too.   

Please read and learn the following material.  It is all short:

1. Github Flow
   * Github Flow Illustrated Guide: [https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
   * Description on githubflow.io:  [https://githubflow.github.io/](https://githubflow.github.io/). Step *#5 -merge only after pull request review* is important!  But I disagree with step #6.
2. Git branches - needed for Github Flow
   * Basic Branching and Merging [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
3. Creating a Pull Request on Github 
   * [https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
   * Its easy -- just click a button
   * The important part is a *descriptive title* and *good description*
4. Commenting on a Pull Request
   * The point of Pull Request is to request review and/or feedback
   * This page gives examples of how to: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request)
