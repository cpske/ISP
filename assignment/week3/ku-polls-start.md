title: Requirements Specification for KU Polls
---

Write a specification for the KU Polls application,
and setup a Github repository for your documents and code.

This week

1. Create a public repository named `ku-polls` in your *own* Github account.
2. Add a README.md that briefly describes that the repository is for and contains links to your product docs.
3. Add a Wiki to your repository.  The Wiki should contain there 2 files:
   * Vision - vision of the product
   * Requirements - a specification of the requirements
4. When you complete work, schedule an online review with a TA or instructor.

## Details

### 1. Vision Statement

You can use the class vision statement, which we will update later.
Vision short be short and realistic, so avoid adding idealistic features
you can't implement.

A Vision should be **visual**.  Add an image of the solution.

### 3. Requirements Specification

Many Agile projects use "story cards", but for now we will use the old fashion
list of functional and non-functional requirements.

Write the requirements as a list.  Don't embellish (add new requirements).
In class, we will discuss some guidelines for a good requirement, which include:

* Clear
* Consistent
* Complete
* Feasible
* Necessary
* Unambiguous
* Singular (one requirement is one thing)
* Testable
