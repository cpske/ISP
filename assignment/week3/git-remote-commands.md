title: Git Remote Commands Assignment
---

## Instructions

In the `git-commands` repository you created last week, add this work.

1. In your local `git-commands` repository create a new branch named `remote-commands`.  Switch to that branch.

2. Copy the file named `remote-commands.md` from this repository: <https://github.com/ISP21/git-commands/>. Hint: the file is **not** on the master branch.

3. Answer the questions in `remote-commands.md` and test your answers.  Use good Markdown formatting.

4. In your README.md, add a hyperlink to the "7. Commands for Remotes" section of `remote-commands.md`, in your table of contents (links near top of README).
   - Now you should have links to each section and references near the top of README.md

5. Commit your work (still on the `remote-commands` branch).

6. Switch back to "master" and merge the "remote-commands" branch into "master".
   - Since you added work only to "remote-commands" branch, this should be an easy "fast forward" merge -- no conflicts.

7. Push **both** "master" and "remote-commands" branches to Github.


> This is the way developers work on software. You add new work on a branch and test it. 
> For a team project, also ask the team to approve the work ("Pull Request"). 
> Finally, merge your branch into master.
