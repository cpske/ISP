## Git Remote Commands Assignment

In the `git-commands` repository you created last week, add this work.

1. Create a local branch named `remote-commands`.

2. In the `remote-commands` branch, add a file name `remote-commands.md`.

3. Write the questions below and there answer in this file. Use good Markdown formatting.

4. In README.md, add a hyperlink to this file, near the top.  Your README might look like this:
   ```
   [Git Basics](#basics)
   [Adding and Changing Stuff)(#adding-and-changing-stuff)
   <!-- these three sections are in separate files -->
   [Undoing Changes](undoing-changes.md)
   [Branch and Merge](branch-and-merge.md)
   [Remote Commands](remote-commands.md)

   ### Basics
   ...
   ```

5. Commit your remote commands and updated README to the remote-commands branch.

6. Merge this branch into `master`.

7. Push **both branches** to Github.  This requires 2 push commands.
   

### Commands for Remotes

Write the answers to these usage situations.

1. The command to show a list all your remote repositories, with their URL.

2. The command to view details about a rempote repo, including all the remote banches and local tracking branches.

3. When working on a local branch named `bugfix` you type `git push` and git responds:
   ```
   Fatal: The current branch bugfix has no upstream branch.
   ```
   What should you do so you can "push" this branch to `origin`?


4. Suppose the remote `origin` has a branch named `dev-factory`. What is the command to copy it to your local repository and track it?


5. (One of the questions from last week is about remotes. Move it here.)
