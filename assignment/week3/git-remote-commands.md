title: Git Remote Commands Assignment
---

In the `git-commands` repository you created last week, add this work.

1. Create a local branch named `remote-commands`.

2. In the `remote-commands` branch, add a file named `remote-commands.md`.

3. Write the questions below and there answer in this file. Use good Markdown formatting.

4. In README.md, add a hyperlink to this file, near the top.  Your README might look like this:
   ```
   [Git Basics](#1.-basics)
   [Adding and Changing Stuff)(#2.-adding-and-changing-stuff)
   <!-- these three sections are in separate files -->
   [Undoing Changes](undoing-changes.md)
   [Branch and Merge](branch-and-merge.md)
   [Remote Commands](remote-commands.md)         <-- new section

   ### 1. Basics
   ...
   ```

5. Commit your remote commands and updated README to the `remote-commands` branch. Verify the formatting is correct.

6. Merge this branch into `master`.

7. Push **both branches** to Github (master and remote-commands).  This requires 2 push commands.


### Commands for Remotes

Write the answers to these usage situations.

1. The command to list all your remote repositories, with their URL.

2. The command to view details about a rempote repo named `origin`, including all the remote banches, and local tracking branches.

3. (Question 7 from Part 4 belongs in this section, so move it here.) 

4. (Question 8 from Part 4 belongs in this section, so move it here.)

5. What are the steps to resolve the problem in the previous problem?

6. Suppose you want to move `origin` to a different URL.  This can happen if you change the name of a repo on Github, or transfer ownership from one person to another.  What is the command to change the URL for `origin` to `https://github.com/your_name/newrepo`.
