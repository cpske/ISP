### Create a Github "Project" for Task Tracking

You will use a Github "Project" to record and track your work.

A Github "Project" can contain 2 kinds of forms or views:
- table view containing all tasks. This is useful for defining the backlog.
- task board with columns for task status, such as "Todo", "In-progress", and "Done".

You will create one "task board" for each iteration.  

To get started, create a "table view" named Backlog that includes all tasks.

You can choose your own columns, but a minimal task table looks like this:

| Title         | Assignee | Status  | Iteration  | Description       |
|---------------|----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Tutorial Part 1 |        | `Todo`  | `Iteration 1` | Implement Django Tutorial Part 1 |
|               |          |         |               |                |

The `Iteration` column has a fixed set of values ("Iteration 1", etc.).

The task board for Iteration 1 uses a *filter* to show only the tasks (from the task table) that have a value of "Iteration 1").  It is extra work to set up the Backlog table at start, but it saves time in later iterations. And the table is a convenient way to see all the work.
