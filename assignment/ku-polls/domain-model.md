title: KU Polls Domain Model
---

Add a UML class diagram of your *domain model* to your project documents.    
- Use correct UML notation
- Add a link to "Domain Model" in the Wiki Home page.

In the diagram show:

- your model classes
- relationship between your model classes, with multiplicity
  - Use the correct line type and direction on the arrow for *association*.
- model attributes with their datatype.  Don't show the automatic `id` attribute.
- in model classes, show methods that you write, but not inherited methods
- inheritance. For Django's own class(es) don't try to show the attributes and methods.  Show only the important methods your model classes use!
  - these are the CRUD methods (create, retrieve, update, delete)
- use correct UML notation
