## Assignment

1. Use flake8 on your KU Polls project and revise the code until you don't get any errors or warnings from flake8.

2. Create a `config.cfg` file in your Django project to customize flake8, such as ignoring files in the `migrations` directory (not your code).  For example:
   
   ```
[flake8]
# Django recommends allowing longer lines, such as in models
max-line-length = 119
# test docstrings using PyFlakes
doctests = True

# ignore some errors. Separate codes with comma.
# See Flake8 Configuration page for list of all errors & warnings
ignore =
    E302    # expected 2 blank lines, found 1

exclude =
    # these are excluded by default
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    # ignore virtual environments (not our code)
    env,
    venv,
    # migrations are autogenerated. Pointless to check coding style.
    migrations
   ```
3. Add docstring comments to all your classes and methods. 

4. Check docstring comments using pydocstyle (a Python extension).  You can combine this with flake8 by installing the package `flake8-docstrings`.
