title: KU Polls Iteration 3
---

## New Features to Add in Iteration 3

- A visitor must authenticate (login) in order to submit a vote or change his vote(s).
- Each authenticated user gets only only 1 vote per poll.
- A user can change his vote on a poll during the voting period, and his new vote replaces his old vote. 
- If a user selects a poll he already voted on, the list of choices shows which choice he/she previously selected. For example, a radio button is selected for his previous choice.
- When a user submits a vote there is visual confirmation of his vote, such as a message on the next page he is shown.
- A visitor can login and logout.
- A link for "Login" or "Logout" is shown on all web pages.  It is good UI design if these links appear in the *same place* on all pages (e.g. a common header or sidebar).

Other Behavior:

- Anyone can view the list of polls and poll results (same as before)
- (Optional for now) Add logging of important events, such as login, logout, failed login, and submitting a vote.

## Requirements

Project Management Artifacts:

1. Create an Iteration 3 Plan in your wiki.
2. Review and update your Requirements document. 
3. Update the Development Plan for iteration 3.
4. Add a **Domain Model** to your Wiki. Include a UML class diagram and some text to explain the reasoning for your domain model.
5. Create an Iteration 3 Task Board and add tasks.
   - Also convert task to "Issues" so they appear in your repo on Github.

Software Process and Development:

1. Do work on an `iteration3` branch and push it to Github regularly.
2. Write unit tests to verify the new work is correct and satisfies requirements.
3. Add at least 2 demo users to your database.  In `README.md` add the username and password for these users.  This is so we can use your application.  For **example**
   ```
   | Username  | Password        |
   |-----------|-----------------|
   |   demo1   | stupidpassword1 |
   |   demo2   | stupidpassword2 |
   ```
4. **Data Fixtures** When you are done create new data import files for questions, polls, and users.
   ```
   cmd> python manage.py dumpdata --indent=2 -o data/polls.json polls 
   cmd> python manage.py dumpdata --indent=2 -o data/users.json auth.user
   ```

### Incremental Development

Try to make small changes to the code and test each change so that you 
can easily fix problems.  Commit code after each change.

### Hints

See the documents in Week 6 folder of Google Classroom.


### (Optional) Divide Tests into Separate Files

Your code now has many unit tests, so consider separating tests
into separate files, as recommended in the MDN Django Tutorial.

- Create a `polls/tests` directory with an `__init__.py` file.
- Divide your tests into separate files, with related tests in one file, such as:
  ```
  polls/tests/
             __init__.py
             test_index.py
             test_poll_dates.py
             test_auth.py
             test_voting.py
   ```
- Delete the original `tests.py` file
- Fix the imports in test files. Instead of `.models` use `polls.models`. Similarly for `.views`.


### (Optional) Logging

(Optional) Add logging of some important events:

| Event                      | Log Level |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| user login or logout       | info      |
| unsuccessful login attempt (username or password incorrect) | warning |
| user submits a vote        | info      |

- all log messages should include the date and time (that's done by the formatter, don't put it in your log message).
- login/logout messages should include the user's IP address
- log to the console, like Django does.
- use `loggers`, not print statements!

Django uses Python's logging library. 

You configure the logger behavior, including message format, in `settings.py`.

An example of using logging is:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("polls") 

logger.info(f"{user} logged in from {ip_addr}")
logger.warn(f"Invalid login attempt for {username} from {ip_addr}")
logger.error("Caught unexpected exception: " + str(exception))
```

### Getting a Visitor's IP Address (for Logging)

When someone logs in you should include their IP address in the log message.

There are many posts showing how to write a `get_client_ip` 
function using the Django `request` object.
Getting the visitor's **actual** IP address is harder than it looks,
as commenters mention here:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4581789/how-do-i-get-user-ip-address-in-django>

One implementation (copied from the Internet)
uses HttpRequest headers sent by the client, 
`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` and `REMOTE_ADDR`

```python
def get_client_ip(request):
    """Get the visitorâ€™s IP address using request headers."""
    x_forwarded_for = request.META.get('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR')
    if x_forwarded_for:
        ip = x_forwarded_for.split(',')[0]
    else:
        ip = request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR')
    return ip
```
this is OK, but request headers can be manipulated by the sender.
