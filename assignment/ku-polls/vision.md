## Background

KU staff and students often want to conduct polls or surveys
within KU, or within a unit or organization at KU.
The polls or surveys provide input for making decisions,
planning events, and learning others' preferences and ideas,
but they aren't critical (like voting for a representative).

The most common poll/survey questions are multiple choice, 
where the poll taker selects a choice from a list of choices.

There are applications for this on the Internet,
such as Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, but they all
have limitations or unwanted features.  
Google Forms is clumsy and a returning visitor cannot
see his previously submitted choices, but he can submit
new choices if the form settings are set to allow it.
Google Forms do not have a setting for automatic start 
and end date; the form creator must manually enable/disable responses.

SurveyMonkey has limits on free forms, including the
number of survey items and number of responses.

## Vision

For the KU community
who want to conduct surveys and polls open to the community,
and who may wish to specify starting/ending dates for the survey or poll,
our product is an easy to use web application that 
provides ability to submit a choice on poll items,
and view or modify one's choice any time during the polling period.

Our product has a simple procedure for creating polls,
and allows everyone to see the results of a poll or survey.

## Additional Detail

The opening and closing dates for each poll/survey question are optional.  
A question is not visible to web visiters before the opening date,
and voting or modifying an existing vote is not allowed after
the closing date, but the poll/survey and results can be 
viewed after the closing date.

## Alternative Solutions

There are other free web-based applications for conducting polls and surveys.
Two such products are:

* Google Forms - can have several types of questions including multiple choice, matrix, short answer, and free-form long answer. The form owner can manually enable/disable collecting responses and limit the scope to a Google organization.

* Survey Monkey - (students should write their own summary of this)
