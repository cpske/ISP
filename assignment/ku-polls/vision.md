# Vision of KU Polls Application

## Background

KU staff and students frequently want to conduct polls or surveys
within KU, or among a unit or organization at KU.
The polls and surveys are usually not critical,
but provide useful input for making decisions,
planning events, and learning others' preferences and ideas.

The most common poll or survey questions are multiple choice, 
where the poll taker select one choice from among a list of choices.
Another common characteristic is the a survey question
has a start and stop date.

There exist applications on the Internet for this,
such as Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, but they all
have limitations.  Google Forms is clumsy and often
does not allow a visitor to view and edit a previous
submission, and no automatic way to set a start and stop date.

SurveyMonkey has limits on free forms, including the
number of survey items and number of responses.

## Vision of KU Polls Application

For the KU community
who want to conduct surveys and polls open to the community,
and who may want to specify a range of dates for the survey or poll;
our product is an easy to use web application that 
provides ability to submit a choice on poll items,
and view or modify one's choice any time during the poll period.
It also allows everyone to see the results of a poll or survey.

## Additional Features

The opening and closing dates for each poll/survey question are optional.  
A question is not visible to web visiters before the opening date,
and voting or modifying an existing vote is not allowed after
the closing date, but the question and results can still be viewed.
