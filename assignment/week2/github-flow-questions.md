## Questoins about Github Flow

There are other questions in the Google form (assignment) for week 2.

1. What is the One Rule of Github Flow? 

There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.

2. You want to implement a new feature to your web app:
let users login using OAuth (when you go to a web site
and it has "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook",
it uses a protocol called OAuth to do that).

What would be a good name for this branch? (Following
advice in the Github Flow docs)

3. When you want to request feedback from other on your work, 
what should you do?


4. You should open a Pull Request when?
[ ] you start work on a new feature
[ ] you find a bug in your work
[ ] you finish work on the branch
[ ] you want review and feedback from others
[ ] your time on the task exceeds estimated time, 
    so you want Scrum Master to review it

5. After you open a Pull Request, what are some things the team might
comment on?
[ ] Coding style
[ ] Unit tests are missing some test cases or not covering the code
[ ] Suggest some refactoring
[ ] Bugs or something you forgot to do in your work
[ ] Another way you might implement something
[ ] Compliment on your good work

6. When you finish work on the feature and it passes your unit tests,
what should you to test the application with your feature?
[ ] Open a Pull Request and request permission to deploy it
[ ] Merge into master so the Continuous Integration system will test it
[ ] Merge into master and deploy the application to production site
[ ] Deploy from the feature branch to a pre-production site
[ ] Any of these 

7. When you (finally) are ready to merge your feature into the master branch,
what should you do?
[ ] Just do it - merge into master
[ ] Merge master into the feature branch to check for conflicts, then reset "master" to point to the branch
[ ] Open a Pull Request to request others review and approve the final code
[ ] Something else
