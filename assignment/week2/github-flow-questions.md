1. What is the One Rule of Github Flow? 

There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable.


You want to implement a new feature to your web app:
let users login using OAuth (when you go to a web site
and it has "Login with Google" or "Login with Facebook",
it uses a protocol called OAuth to do that).

What would be a good name for this branch? (Following
advice in the Github Flow docs)

When you want to request feedback from other on your work, 
what should you do?


You open a pull request when?
[ ] you start work on a new feature
[ ] you find a bug in your work
[ ] you finish work on the branch
[ ] you want review and feedback from others
[ ] your time on the task exceeds estimated time, 
    so you want Scrum Master to review it

After you open a Pull Request, what are some things the team might
comment on?
[ ] Coding style
[ ] Unit tests are missing some test cases or not covering the code
[ ] Suggest some refactoring
[ ] Bugs or something you forgot to do in your work
[ ] Another way you might implement something
[ ] Compliment on your good work

When you finish work on the feature and it passes your tests,
what can you do to ensure it works?
[ ] Open a Pull Request and request permission to deploy it
[ ] Merge into master so the Continuous Integration system will test it
[ ] Merge into master and deploy the application to production site
[ ] Deploy from the feature branch to a pre-production site
[ ] Any of these 

When you (finally) are ready to merge your feature into the master branch,
what should you do?
[ ] Just do it - merge into master
[ ] Merge master into the feature branch to check for conflicts, then reset "master" to point to the branch
[ ] Open a Pull Request to request others review and approve the final code
[ ] Something else

When your feature work has progressed enough, how to you
request feedback from others?
