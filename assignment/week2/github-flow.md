## Learn Git Branching, Pull Requests, and Github Flow

Github Flow is a workflow for projects using Git, 
whether you are working alone or on a team.
Github Flow uses git branches and "pull requests", 
so you need to understand those, too.  
Don't worry, they are pretty simple.

Please read the following material.  Its all short:

1. Github Flow
   * Github Flow Illustrated Guide: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
   * Description on githubflow.io:  https://githubflow.github.io/. Step *#5 -merge only after pull request review* is important!  But I disagree with step #6.
2. Git branches - needed for Github Flow
   * Basic Branching and Merging https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging
3. Creating a Pull Request on Github 
   * https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request
   * its easy -- just click a button
   * the important part is a *descriptive title* and *good description*
4. Commenting on a Pull Request
   * the point of pull request is to request review and/or feedback
   * this page gives examples of howto: https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request

Some questions will be posted to test your understanding.
