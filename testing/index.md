Introduction to Testing: [PDF](Intro-to-Testing.pdf) [PPT](Intro-to-Testing.ppt)

There are many types of testing used in software projects

* Unit testing for testing individual components (classes and methods)
* Integration testing to test that components and services interact correctly
* Functional or end-to-end testing to test the entire application flow and behavior
* Acceptance testing, often required when delivering a software product 


## Unit Testing

* Why do unit testing?

* How to design test cases?

* Python Unit Testing: [PDF](PythonUnitTesting.pdf) [PPT](PythonUnitTesting.ppt)
  - Python standard unittest (similar to JUnit) and doctest
  - [PyTest](https://www.pytest.org) is another popular, light-weight testing framework

* [Code Coverage](code-coverage.md) - using tools to assess how much of your code is really being tested by unit tests.

* Mock Objects to provide 'stand in' or dummy objects for components that a method uses, but that aren't under test.

## Web Testing
