### Online Courses

[Writing Professional Code](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV275x+2T2017) Course DEV275x at edX.  A course by Microsoft. It uses dot-net for exercises and has some dot-net specific questions.  You should study the whole course, but OK to skip .Net problems.
  * This course is part of [Microsoft Entry-Level Software Development Professional Program](https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-entry-level-software) on edX.  Looks interesting. Relevent to this course:
  * Course 5: Writing Professional Code

  * Course 9: Building a Functional Prototype with Node.js

[Engineering Software as a Service](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS_CS169.1x/1T2014/course/) Berkeley CS169.1x at edX.  A very popular course from UC Berkeley.  The courses uses Ruby (we don't) but the content is very valuable.  Some of it belongs in "Workgroup Software Process".

[Software Processes and Agile Practices](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-processes-and-agile-practices), U. of Alberta on Coursera. 
  * The course title describes it.  Fairly short course (4 modules).
