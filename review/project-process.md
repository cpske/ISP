title: Apply a Process to a Project
---

Scenario: *Your company assigns you to lead a project to build software for a real customer paying real money.*

What do you do?

### Process Practices

- Apply Agile values     
  *customer collaboration*     
  *prioritize requirements - deliver value early and often*     
  *embrace change* (but manage it, or suffer)       
  *involve the whole team*

- Plan before Do    
  > "In preparing for battle I have found that plans are useless,    
  > but planning is indespenable."    
  > - General D. Eisenhower (WWII General, later U.S. President)

- Information Radiator    
  *One location for all info about a project*    
  *Badges for CI status*    
  *Living documentation* - update it constantly

- Time-boxed iterations     
  *maintain a sustainable pace*    
  *not-done work is not a failure*   

### Development Practices

- Use a task board

- Use an issue tracker, too

- Use a coding standard that everyone agrees on

- Design (and review) before coding

- Daily Stand-up Meetings

- Write clean, readable code. *documentation in code*

- Automate    
  *Write tests for everything*     
  *Code Checking Tools* flake8, pylint, pypy    
  *Use C.I.*

- Review Everything
  *Pull Requests*    
  *Walk-throughs*

- Refactor to improve design & code

### Personal & Process Improvement

- *Have a Career Goal*   
  "*If you don't know where you want to go,    
  any road will take you there.*"

- Retrospective    

- Allow slack time & learning time    
  *Production* vs  *Productive Capacity*

- Learn from Others
