title: UML Diagrams
---

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard set of diagrams for describing software.  There are diagrams for:

* static structure
* dynamic behavior
* deployment
* use cases

In UML 2.2 there are 14 types of diagrams. 

The most common ones, which you should know how to read and draw, are:

* Class Diagram
* Sequence Diagram
* State Machine Diagram

The 'Activity Diagram' is equally popular as Sequence Diagram,
but the Sequence Diagram has clearer notation and is easier to read,
so we will use that.

The 'Use Case Diagram' is also widely used, but, the Use Case *Text* is more important than the diagram.

## Sequence Diagram

Slides: [Sequence Diagram Tutorial](Sequence-Diagram-Tutorial.pdf)

* Very visual tutorial with explanation: https://www.smartdraw.com/sequence-diagram/

* Excellent slides based on *UML Distilled*: http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/CS389/L9/Sequence%20Diagram%20Tutorial.pdf
  - slides more explanatory than in the book

### System Sequence Diagram

System Sequence Diagram (SSD) is a simplified sequence diagram showing 
interaction between the user and system.
Details of what the system does are now shown.
It may also show interaction between the "system" and *external services* or "*actors*".

It's useful for design of a particular usage scenario to discover all the
interactions.
