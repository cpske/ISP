title: UML Diagramming Tools

## Online UML Tools with free tier:

- [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/uml_diagram_tool)

- [Miro](https://miro.com/diagramming/uml-class-diagram/)

- [Diagrams.net](https://www.draw.io) - General purpose drawing tool that includes UML.  Save/load diagrams using Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, OneDrive, or your local computer.

- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) free and open-source diagramming tool that creates UML from a simple text description (not drag & drop). It has integrations with Pycharm, IntelliJ, and Eclipse, among others.

- [VisualParadigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/diagrams/solutions/free-class-diagram-tool/) free online tools for UML and other diagrams. Can save files to Google Drive.

- [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org) (free) can draw very detailed, elaborate Sequence Diagrams.  Uses a simple textual description of the diagram to generate the diagram.  This gives you a lot of control and ability to copy/paste or download diagram details.

## Desktop Tools

- [Umlet](https://www.umlet.com) free and open-source. UI is a combination of drag-and-drop with a text pane to enter or edit details.

- Microsoft Visio 

- [Violet UML Editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/) and [source](https://github.com/violetumleditor/violetumleditor). I sometimes use this free tool, originally by Cay Horstmann.  Development is mostly inactive. Class diagrams are good, but its difficult (or impossible) to create detailed Sequence and State Chart diagrams.
