# Steps in Creating a Web Application

This is done iteratively.
You should try to perform steps 1 and 2 thoroughly early 
in the project, but don't become *paralyzed* trying to get everything.

1. Who are the users?  What do they want? (aka, *Users and their goals*)
   * Software is for users.
   * Requirements come from users.
   * Identifying users also helps in design.
   * Write this down.

1. Identify functional and non-functional requirements.
   * Focus on the more important ones. What should this app do?
   * Write them down. Divide into functional and non-functional.
   * Not necessary to be thorough or complete.

3. UI Design - sketches, wireframe, mockups
   * How will the app give users what they want?
   * Strive for a simple, intuitive UI.
   * Screens: what are the screens?  How do they relate to each other?

4. Plan the Interations
   * system sequence diagrams to show interaction between user and app
   * each functional requirement probably requires one or more diagram

5. Design the components
   * Pick one feature or function.
