The Mozilla Develper Network (MDN) also has a good series of articles.
[Client-Server Overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview) describes HTTP requests and responses, and difference between static and dynamic content.  It then describes what web frameworks do.  They mention Django and Flask for Python.



## Web Development

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials MDN recommended tutorials on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

[4 Python Web Frameworks Compared](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/149/4-python-web-frameworks-compared) episode of the "Talk Python" podcast.  
He compares Django, Flask, Pyramid, and Tornado, and explains the
important differences between them and which one may be best for
which kind of project.

[Empirical comparison of Rails, Grails, Django, Code Igniter][clavijo] compared time students needed to (a) complete some programming problems in each language, (b) develop a blogging web site in each one.  **Django** was the most productive of the 4 frameworks.
