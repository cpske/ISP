[Empirical comparison of Rails, Grails, Django, Code Igniter][clavijo] compared time students needed to (a) complete some programming problems in each language, (b) develop a blogging web site in each one.  Django was the most productive of the 4.

[Gearheart][Gearheart] reviews a few standard frameworks including Django, Ruby on Rails, and Angular.js, and React.  He feels that Rails enables writing less code, but has some learning curve if you don't know Ruby.   He didn't review any Java frameworks.
