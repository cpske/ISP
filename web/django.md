## Install Django

Install from [www.djangoproject.com/download/](https://www.djangoproject.com/download).

Django 2.x requires Python 3 and uses the `pip` command to install Django as a package.
To check your Python version use:
```
cmd> python --version
```
It should print "Python 3.6.0" or similar.  If you don't have *at least* Python 3.5, you should upgrade.
