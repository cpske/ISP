## Build the Chromium Web Browser

[Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/Home) 
has [instructions)(https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code)
for how to build Chromium on different platforms, including mobile!

But Chromium uses a lot of unusual build tools, including some things they wrote themselves.

Interesting, but not a good example for learning about build automation.
