* What is a software process, and what are its components?
* All devs have a software process, whether they realize it or not.
* If you never thought about your process, then it is *implicit*.  If it changes on each project, then its *ad hoc*.  Both *implicit* and *ad hoc* processes tend to be inefficient and hard to predict the outcomes. 
* The problems of software development that drive the need for a good software process are
  - complexity
  - change
  - (high) defects and errors
  - need to estimate time and cost
  - lack of predictability or consistency
  - (un)maintainability
* Along with software process you need to know the software development lifecycle, since the process and SDLC influence each other.
