Markdown is a mark-up language for formatted documentation on the web.  It's also **easy to learn**, and much easier to read and write than HTML.  Some sites even let you embed HTML in Markdown docs (Github does).

Every developer should know how to use Markdown.  The `README.md` file in Git repositories should contain Markdown formatting.  Your project documentation, whether it's in a Github Wiki or elsewhere, is typically written in either **Markdown** or **reStructuredText**.

## Good Places to Learn Markdown

Github docs:
- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for beginners.
- [Basic Markdown Syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) 2-page PDF, including Github extensions, but not a complete ref.

## Three Markdown Extensions for VS Code

VS Code and PyCharm have built-in Markdown previewers, so you don't need any extension to use Markdown.  However, many Markdown users recommend these three extensions for using Markdown in VS Code.

Please seach the VS Code extensions to get a current link:

* Markdown All in One - tools for writing Markdown faster, including autocompletion, keyboard shortcuts, and TOC generation.
* Markdown Preview Enhanced - a better previewer.  Can preview lots of content that is often embedded in Markdown (PlantUML, Math), and knows about Github-flavored Markdown.
* Markdownlint - a linter to find mistakes in Markdown

> Be cautious of **VS Code Extensions**.
> Many are buggy or not well maintained. I usually choose only extensions authored by Microsoft or a trusted company like Redhat, and only the extensions I really need.
