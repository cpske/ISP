title: Introduction to ISP
---

Presentation: [Introduction to Course](Introduction-to-Course.pdf)     

Individual Software Process (ISP) covers the fundamentals of software process,
focusing on the knowledge and skills to be an effective software developer -- both individually and on a team.

Topics include software process models, writing good quality code, reviewing and testing code, refactoring, using a Git workflow, automation, Agile values and principles, performing iterative development in a small team, and process improvement.

"Good code" includes consistently using a coding convention, documenting code, writing code that is readable and testable, reviewing, and restructuring (refactoring) when needed.

To practice these skills, you will develop a small web application as part of a team, and learn about HTTP and web frameworks.

*01219346 Software Process &amp; Project Management*
covers software process in more depth. 

### Goals

1. Gain knowledge, skills, and habits to be an effective developer -- both individually and on a team
2. Ability to write good quality, correct, maintainable code
3. Understand software process fundamentals and their purpose


### Topics

Topics are listed on the [course index page](../topics) on github.io.

## Coursework


* Weekly Online Meeting, Monday 10:00-12:00 via Google Meet
* May have Live Class in E204 if the epidemic subsides.  Announced in advance.
* Weekly Lab 13:00-16:00. This is online for now.
* Quiz some weeks
* Weekly Reading and Problems. Please do the readings and learn from them.
* Small Team Software Project
* Regular virtual/live meetings with TAs

Platform we will use:

* [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) for announcements, assignments, and discussion.
* Github Classroom for some assignments and quizzes. 
* Course Material on [cpske.github.io/ISP/](https://cpske.github.io/ISP/). 
* Discord?  For Q&A, announcements.


### Effort and Commitment

Plan to spend **10-12 hours per week** on ISP.

* Read assigned material each week
* Do exercises and assignments yourself, submit work on-time
* Write and review code regularly
* Ask TAs and instructors for help, instead of asking other students
* Team Project: mostly in 2nd half of course. This may require extra time.

### Online Education Requires Commitment & Discipline!

Most learners don't complete online courses.  They fall behind or drop out.  

Successful online learners **plan** to **commit time and effort** to the course.

Plan your time, make a schedule, have discipline. 

### Software You Need

* IDE such as Eclipse (Pydev), IntelliJ (PyCharm), or VS Code
* Python 3.8 or newer
* Good text editor (something better than Notepad). IDE is OK, but slow for editing a single file. 
  - Examples: Atom, Notepad++, Sublime, VS Code (a bit slow), TextMate (for Mac)
* Git command line client. 
  - The Git tool included in IDEs is useful and requires less typing, but you still need the command line `git` and know how to use it!


### Why a Team Software Project?

In this course you will design, implement, and deploy a web application
in a team of approx. 4 people.  You can choose the project topic, 
subject to approval by instructor.

A big challenge in creating software is working effectively as a team.  
Many of the skills we study involve other people, 
and are intended to improve team work.

Hence, we need a *team* project to practice both individual and project-related skills.
The project is also an opportunity to learn the basics of HTTP, web frameworks, and web application development.

Last year's students report that the project is the most valuable part of the course.


### This is Not a Powerpoint Course

"Powerpoint" slides are an aid to presentation.
They don't contain much depth and not all the material. 

You must read the assigned material and learn from hands-on work 
for a real understanding.

If you only study "slides", you won't learn much and probably won't
pass the course.


## Prerequisites

* Programming ability at level of Programming 2, including object-oriented programming
* Ability to use Git and Github
* Know how to use command line interface to view and modify files, navigate the file system.  Bash shell, Z-shell, or Windows CMD prompt are OK.

Programming 2 is essential. If you have not taken it yet, please don't enroll in this course.


## Grading

Your grade is based on    

- *quizzes and exams*
- *assignments*
- *participation in class*
- *project work and use of good software process*

The project score is based on how well you apply a process and your consistent contribution.  The final product is only a small part of the project score.

**Minimum Exam Average**: 
You must achieve an overall average exam score of at least 50% to pass.

The approximate grading scale is:

<table align="center" border="1" width="40%">
<tr> <th width="20%">Overall Score</th> <th width="20%"> Grade </th> </tr>
<tr> <td> 85 - 100</td> <td>  A  </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 80 - 85 </td> <td>  B+ </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 75 - 80 </td> <td>  B  </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 70 - 75 </td> <td>  C+ </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 65 - 70 </td> <td>  C  </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 60 - 65 </td> <td>  D+ </td></tr>
<tr> <td> 55 - 60 </td> <td>  D  </td></tr>
<tr> <td> &nbsp;0 - 55 </td> <td>  F  </td></tr>
