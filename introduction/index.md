title: Introduction to Course
---  

This course covers the basics of common software processes and process models,
and focuses on on the knowledge, skills, and habits that you need to be an effective software developer -- either solo or on a team. This includes:

* Ability to write good code that's testable and maintainable.
* Apply an iterative and increment life cycle to develop software 
* Using version control as part of a workflow that includes branching, issue tracking, testing, and review
* Consistenting using a coding standard and documenting code
* Testing
* Design and code reviews
* Refactoring existing software
* Automation of tests and deployment
* Attention to detail
* Learn to develop *faster* by automating repetitive work and following a process instead of re-inventing one for each project (*ad hoc* process).

A simple nmenonic for the goals of a software project is:
"Build the Right Product", "Build the Product Right", and "Build it Fast".  
This course focuses on skills and habits to "Build it Right".

The follow-on course 
01219346 *Software Process &amp; Project Management*
covers software process in more depth, including things aimed in "building the right product".

"Good code" requirs consistently using a coding convention, documenting code, writing code that is readable and testable, reviewing, and updating (refactoring) code when needed.

### Skills Every Developer Should Have

### Why a Team Software Project?

In this course you will design, implement, and deploy a web application
using a team of approx. 4 people.  Since this is a course on *individual* process, why a *team* project?

Part of the challenge of creating software is working effectively
as a team.  Many of the skills we study in this course are intended
for teams (such as pull requests, retrospectives).

Previous students say that the project is the most valuable part
of the course.

### Not a Powerpoint Course

Powerpoint slides are intended as an aid to presentation,
and don't contain much material or depth. 

You must read the assigned material and learn from hands-on work 
for a real understanding.
If you only study "slides", you won't learn much and probably won't
pass the course.

### Grading

Your grade is based on    
*quizzes and exams*    
*assignments*    
*participation in class*    
*project work*

The project score is based on how well you allow a process, effort, and consistent contribution.  The final product is only a small part of the project score.

The approximate grading scale is:

| Overall Score | Grade |
|---------------|-------|
| 85 - 100      |   A   |
| 80 - 85       |   B+  |
| 75 - 80       |   B   |
| 70 - 75       |   C+  |
| 65 - 70       |   C   |
| 60 - 65       |   D+  |
| 55 - 60       |   D   |
|  0 - 55       |   F   |

**Minimum Exam Average**: 
You must also achieve an overall average exam score of at least 50% to pass.


## Assignment

1. Join the Github organization and Google Classroom for this course.
2. Update your profile on Github to include a photo that clearly shows your face (at least 50% of vertical space) and real name (at least first name) correctly capitalized.  Also include a photo that clearly shows your face in your Google profile.
