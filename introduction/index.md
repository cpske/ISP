title: Introduction to ISP
---

Individual Software Process (ISP) covers the fundamentals of software process
and process models,
focusing on the knowledge aand skills to be an effectiv software developer -- either solo or on a team.

The goals are:

1. Gain knowledge, skills, and habits to be an effective member of a development team
2. Ability to write good, maintainable code
3. Understanding of software process fundamentals and their purpose.


The specific topics are listed on the [course index page](/ISP/) on github.io.
Topics include

* Ability to write good code that's testable and maintainable
* Coding standard and documenting code
* Iterative and incremental development life cycle 
* Version control as part of a workflow
* Testing
* Design and code reviews
* Refactoring existing software
* Automation of tests and deployment
* Good developer habits, esp. attention to detail
* Learn to develop *faster* by automating repetitive work and following a process instead of re-inventing one for each project (*ad hoc* process).


"Good code" requires consistently using a coding convention, documenting code, writing code that is readable and testable, reviewing, and updating (refactoring) code when needed.

01219346 *Software Process &amp; Project Management*
covers software process in more depth, including areas aimed in "building the right product".  This course is more aimed at "*building the product right*".

### Why a Team Software Project?

In this course you will design, implement, and deploy a web application
using a team of approx. 4 people.  You can choose the project topic, 
subject to approval by instructor.

Part of the challenge of creating software is working effectively
as a team.  Many of the skills we study involve other people, 
and are intended to improve team work.

Hence, we need a *team* project to practice both individual and project-related skills.
The project is also an opportunity to learn the basics of HTTP, web frameworks, and web application development.

Prior year students say that the project is the most valuable part of the course.


### Not a Powerpoint Course

Powerpoint slides are intended as an aid to presentation,
and don't contain much material or depth. 

You must read the assigned material and learn from hands-on work 
for a real understanding.
If you only study "slides", you won't learn much and probably won't
pass the course.

### Grading

Your grade is based on    
- *quizzes and exams*    
- *assignments*    
- *participation in class*    
- *project work and use of good software process*

The project score is based on how well you apply a process, effort, and consistent contribution.  The final product is only a small part of the project score.

The approximate grading scale is:

| Overall Score | Grade |
|---------------|-------|
| 85 - 100      |   A   |
| 80 - 85       |   B+  |
| 75 - 80       |   B   |
| 70 - 75       |   C+  |
| 65 - 70       |   C   |
| 60 - 65       |   D+  |
| 55 - 60       |   D   |
|  0 - 55       |   F   |

**Minimum Exam Average**: 
You must achieve an overall average exam score of at least 50% to pass.
