## Focus of this Course

* Focus on the basic knowledge, skills, and habits that every developer should know.
* Ability to write good code that's testable and maintainable.

* 3 project dimensions of "Build the Right Product", "Build the Product Right", "Build it Fast".  This course focuses on skills and habits to help you "Build it Right".
* Learn to develop *faster* by automating repetitive work and following a process instead of re-inventing one for each project (*ad hoc* process).

"Good code" means consistently using a coding convention, documenting code, writing code that is readable and testable, reviewing and updating (refactoring) code when needed.
