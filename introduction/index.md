title: Introduction to ISP
---

Individual Software Process (ISP) focuses on on the knowledge, skills, and habits to be an effective software developer -- either solo or on a team.
The course also covers basics of common software processes and process models.

The goals are:

1. Knowledge, skills, and habits to be an effective member of a development team
2. Ability to write good, maintainable code
3. Understanding of software process fundamentals, and their purpose.


The specific topics are listed on the [course index page](/ISP/) on github.io.

* Ability to write good code that's testable and maintainable.
* Iterative and incremental development life cycle 
* version control as part of a workflow that includes branching, issue tracking, testing, and review
* Coding standard and documenting code
* Testing
* Design and code reviews
* Refactoring existing software
* Automation of tests and deployment
* Attention to detail
* Learn to develop *faster* by automating repetitive work and following a process instead of re-inventing one for each project (*ad hoc* process).


"Good code" requirs consistently using a coding convention, documenting code, writing code that is readable and testable, reviewing, and updating (refactoring) code when needed.

01219346 *Software Process &amp; Project Management*
covers software process in more depth, including things aimed in "building the right product".

### Why a Team Software Project?

In this course you will design, implement, and deploy a web application
using a team of approx. 4 people.  You can choose the project topic, subject
to approval by instructor.

Part of the challenge of creating software is working effectively
as a team.  Many of the skills we study  require other people, and are intended to improve team work.

Hence, we need a *team* project to practice both individual and project-related skills.
A side benefit is learning the basics of HTTP and web application development.

Previous students say that the project is the most valuable part of the course.


### Not a Powerpoint Course

Powerpoint slides are intended as an aid to presentation,
and don't contain much material or depth. 

You must read the assigned material and learn from hands-on work 
for a real understanding.
If you only study "slides", you won't learn much and probably won't
pass the course.

### Grading

Your grade is based on    
- *quizzes and exams*    
- *assignments*    
- *participation in class*    
- *project work*

The project score is based on how well you apply a process, effort, and consistent contribution.  The final product is only a small part of the project score.

The approximate grading scale is:

| Overall Score | Grade |
|---------------|-------|
| 85 - 100      |   A   |
| 80 - 85       |   B+  |
| 75 - 80       |   B   |
| 70 - 75       |   C+  |
| 65 - 70       |   C   |
| 60 - 65       |   D+  |
| 55 - 60       |   D   |
|  0 - 55       |   F   |

**Minimum Exam Average**: 
You must also achieve an overall average exam score of at least 50% to pass.
