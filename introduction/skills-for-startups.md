"*Software Engineering Grads Lack the Skills that Startups Need*"

In an [IEEE Spectrum article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-member-news/software-engineering-grads-lack-the-skills-startups-need), 
software engineer Nitish Devadiga writes that 
startups need people who can build scalable systems for distributed, data-intensive apps using cloud computing.
But, software engineering programs emphasize traditional skills like software processes, analysis, and project management. 

At startups, engineers participate in a broad variety of work including market research, new product ideas, designing system architecture, and cost-effective development.
Iterative development and rapid time to market are important to a startup's survival.  Startups also depend on cloud resources.

"*When you join a startup, there's a lot of emphasis on design of the application, reusability and clean code, and the ability ot conduct and undergo code reviews, as well as the ability to think of and build systems that can scale...*", Devadiga says.
A "*practical understanding of infrastructure architecture design patterns, DevOps, and cloud platform services like compute instances, object storage, and queueing services*" also helps, he says

His view may be biased, since he is principle engineer at a startup specializing in data analytics.
