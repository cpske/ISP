## Online Course Require More Discipline & Commitment

Many students don't benefit from online courses because they
fall behind or drop out.  Online learning requires you to plan
your time, make a commitment to the course, and have discipline.

**Commit**: plan to spend about 10-12 hours per week on ISP

**Plan**: about 4-5 hours on Monday, another 6-8 hours at other times.
    1. read assigned material
    2. do exercises
    3. write and review code
    4. learn new tools and online services

**Project**: during project you will need more than 6 hours/week.
