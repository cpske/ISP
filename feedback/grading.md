The **minimum required exam scores** to pass are: 
- average at least 25% on written exams, and
- average at least 25% on programming exams

This is a very low bar.

The team projects were evaluated based on 

- Software process, including required artifacts (iteration plans, retrospectives, task boards)
- Technology used and quality of implementation
- Product, including required features such as OAuth

some details of project scores will be posted later.
The project scores were good, and helped everyone's grade.
