## Github Flow Practice

In a team create a menu for KU Cafe.
Follow these steps.

## Project Initialization

1. **One** team member create a repo named `kucafeN` (`N`=your row number) in the **ISP19** organzation (not personal repo).
   - Only one repo per TEAM.
   - Public

2. Clone it to your machine.

3. Create 2 files:

File:  **README.md**
```
# KU Cafe

[Menu](menu.md)

## About Us

| Name   | Role  | Github   |

```

```

```

4. Add the files and push to Github.

5. Invite team members.  Settings -> Collaborators.
   - add team members to README.md
   - OK to make team add their own Github ID, but it'll mean more commits.

6. Create a task board using "Projects".
   * Task board should have 4 columns:
       - To do or "Backlog"
       - In Progress or "Started"
       - Review
       - Done
   * Use any template (or none).  Automated Kanban is OK.

7. 3 Tasks
   * Create breakfast menu
   * Create lunch menu
   * Create dinner menu
   Each sub-team (2 people) will implement one task.

8. Implement "Breakfast menu" using Github Flow.
   - pair updates their copy of master
   - pair creates a branch named breakfast-menu and switches to it
   - add menu items (your choice) in menu.md to the table
   - change the title line from "Menu" to "Breakfast Menu"
   - commit and push your changes
   - open a pull request
   - EVERYONE on team pulls the branch and comments on pull request
   - Look for SPELLING ERRORS, wrong words, formatting errors

9. Merge your menu into master!
   - When TEAM approves your changes, pull an update of master branch.
   - Merge your menu into master.
