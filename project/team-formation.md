title: Forming an Effective Project Team
---

### Team Selection

- **Diverse Skill Set** a balance of more and less experienced developers with a variety of skills. This fosters a strong technical foundation with opportunity for knowledge sharing and diverse points of view.
- **Seek people with good attitude and good communication skills**
- **Assess your strengths and weaknesses**.  Fill gaps, accommodate differences.
- **Non-technical Skills** look for management skill, attention to detail, domain knowledge, and ability to work with others.
- **Shared Passion** everyone is interested in the project idea.

### Team Building

- **Early Collaboration** early and ongoing collaboration and discussion of the project and what you aim to achieve.
- **Transparent Communication**
- **Commitment** agree of level of effort you will put into the project.

### Develop a Vision

- Everyone contributes toward a shared vision of the product and shares in background domain research.
- Don't invent in a vacuum. Study the domain area and existing solutions for your proposed topic. No vision without thorough background knowlege.
- Be open and critical. Your first product idea may not be worth the effort. Be open to changing the topic if your first idea doesn't offer much value, or you discover a better topic.


## Examples

An ISP team had a very talented developer who was outstanding at both design and coding.  He also spent time on free-lance work while attending KU.  He headed an ISP team but did not meet face-to-face often. He would decide what should be done each iteration and assign work to team members.

The team did not enjoy the project, even though they learned a lot. They didn't fully understand the architecture or function of parts of the code. The final product was good but not great. (During final presentation I immediately found an obvious bug in their search feature -- it should have been detected before.)
