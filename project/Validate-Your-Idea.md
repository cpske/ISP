10 things to do for a commercial project.  

How can we customize these for an class project whether the goals are somewhat different?

Key steps to evaluate whether an idea for a software project is good or not:

1. Clearly define the problem or need that the software is trying to solve. Understand the target users and their pain points in detail.

2. Research the market and competition. Look for similar existing solutions and understand their strengths, weaknesses, and how your idea can differentiate.

3. Assess the technical feasibility of the idea. Evaluate the technical skills, resources, and time required to build the software. Identify any technical risks or challenges.

4. Estimate the potential user demand and market size. Gauge if there is sufficient demand to justify the investment in developing the software.

5. Analyze the business viability. Estimate the potential revenue, costs, and profit margins. Understand the business model and how the software can generate sustainable revenue.

6. Prioritize the core features and functionalities. Focus on the minimum viable product (MVP) that can deliver value to users and validate the concept.

7. Get early feedback from potential users. Conduct user research, surveys, and interviews to understand if the idea resonates with the target audience.

8. Assess the competitive landscape. Understand how your idea compares to existing solutions in terms of features, pricing, and user experience.

9. Evaluate the risks and challenges. Identify potential roadblocks, technical complexities, regulatory hurdles, or market barriers that could impact the project.

10. Align the idea with your organization's strategic goals and capabilities. Ensure the project fits your company's vision, resources, and expertise.

By thoroughly evaluating these aspects, you can determine whether a software project idea is worth pursuing or if it needs further refinement. The goal is to validate the idea's feasibility, viability, and alignment with user needs before investing significant time and resources.
