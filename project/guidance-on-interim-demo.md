title: Guidance on Interim Demo & Progress Update
---

Imagine the class are partners in a software company, SKE Inc, working on several new products & updates to existing products. 

Each month everyone meets to share their progress, demo software, get feedback and suggestions, and share interesting new knowledge (process related, technology, web dev tools & practices) that may help others.  They also share any problems and solutions, including process-related problems and solutions.

- This as an *internal* and *honest* status update to other company members 
- Purpose is to inform others what you've done & what you'll do by end of semester
- Must be honest
- Share knowledge
  - process practices & tools
  - problems and lessons learned
  - useful technology you are using
  - web dev tips & tricks
- Demo at least 1 major feature you implemented since the last demo
- Allow time for questions

## Things to Include

- Demo what the application can do now. Only major featues (not how to create an account, not how to create a profile unless that's important)
- The timeline of your plan for the remaining dev time.  What will you do?
- Introduce interesting technology you discovered.
- Describe useful practices you adopted that would help other teams.
- Summarize what you learned about development process. Any useful practices your team adopted? Any problems you encountered?


## What Not to Demo

- No sales pitches
- Don't introduce yourselves (everyone already knows you)
- No more than 1 minute introducing the project. Everyone knows that or can read it in your proposal.
- "Powerpoint" is not required. 
- If you *do* have a presentation, never, **never read the text *verbatim* from the slides**.
- Powerpoint should *support* your spoken presentation, not *duplicate* it.

## Evaluation

> I really ***don't*** want to evaluate this -- it's an update and demo.  
> But, if there is not the threat of evaluation, some people don't do what they should.

Not graded based on progress, as long as you have working code.

Not graded based on PowerPoint.

Deductions are for:

- failing to prepare
- not (mostly) following this guidance
