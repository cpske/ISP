Guidance on Presentations

- Treat this as an *internal* status update to other members of the same organization.
- Purpose is to inform others what you've done & what you'll do by end of semester.
- Share knowledge: useful technology you use, web dev tips & tricks, or process practices & tools that help your team.
- Allow time to answer questions.

What to Present

- Demo what the application can do now
- Describe the timeline of your plan for the remaining time.  What will you do?
- Introduce any interesting technology or useful implementation details you discovered.
- Summarize anything you learned about development process. Any useful practices your team adopted?
- Introduce any tools or practices that could help other teams.

What Not to Demo

- No sales pitches
- Don't introduce yourselves (everyone already knows you)
- No more than 30 seconds introducing the project. Everyone knows that or can read it in your proposal.
- "Powerpoint" is not necessary. If you *do* have a presentation, never, never read the text *verbatim* from the slides.
