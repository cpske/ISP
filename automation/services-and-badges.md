## Badge Services

[Shields.io on Github](https://github.com/badges/shields) and [Shields.io](https://shields.io) a site provides badges for various services.

[List of Badges in Markdown](https://github.com/Naereen/badges) many examples, mostly using shields.io.

Open Source Licenses: I suggest you do **not** attach a license to your project **unless** you read and agree to what the license actually states. To learn more, read the [Open Source License Comparison][open-source-licenses] and [ChooseaLicense.com](https://choosealicense.com).
