Refactoring refers to modifying the design of existing code to improve it.

* guide lines for when and how to refactor
* signs that code needs refactoring (sometimes called "code smells", a term I dislike)
* common refactorings, with names
* refactoring Python and Java using an IDE. Eclipse, IntelliJ (aka PyCharm), and Netbeans provide good refactoring tools, VS Code can perform mediocre refactoring.
