Refactoring refers to modifying the design of existing code to improve it.

* signs that code needs refactoring (sometimes called "code smells", a term I dislike)
* what does "improve" mean?  Software principles provide some objective guides.
* guide lines for when and how to refactor
   - code should be working before refactoring
   - you must have tests before refactoring
   - refactor is small steps and only one at a time. Test the result of each refactoring and commit it before doing the next refactoring.
* common refactorings, with names
* refactoring Python and Java using an IDE. Eclipse, IntelliJ (aka PyCharm), and Netbeans provide good refactoring tools, VS Code can perform simple refactoring.
