## Exercise for User Stories

Rewrite these features for the Django Polls application as
user stories, using the pattern:
```
As a ...
I want to ...
So that ...
```

Value: Users can express their preferences on polls. 


Feature 2: Each user can have at most one vote on a poll question.

Feature 3: A user can view and change his choice for a poll question.    
Value: User can change his mind about best choice for a poll, or verify that his previous choice is recorded correctly.
