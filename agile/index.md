## Agile

"Agile" is a set of principles and a philosophy (or mind-set) about software development.  Agile is covered in your third year software process course, so we only discuss the basic principles here.

* [Agile Principles and Practices](agile-principles-practices)
* *Practices Of An Agile Developer*, slides from the book: [PDF](PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper-slides.pdf)
    - we will use parts of this book in this course

## Scrum

Scrum is a popular technique for managing iterations. It can be used with many iterative processes.
