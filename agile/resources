### Articles with Some Good, Some Misinformation

There is a lot of incorrect information about "Agile" on the web.
The two articles below are examples. They are written by knowledgable people
and published on good developer sites, but both contain trite definitions
of "Agile" that are partially incorrect.

You need to think critically to spot some errors.

1. "What is Agile?" on Cprime: https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/
   - Beginning of article has 2 false statements:  
     > Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.
   - **False:** Agile refers to a set of values and principles.  The software development methodologies are based on those values and principles.
   > Another false statement:
     > Agile methods or Agile processes generally promote a disciplined project management process...
   - **False:** Not necessarily so.  Agile relies on dedicated people committed to delivering useful software; it doesn't say much about "disciplined project management".
   - Article is biased toward Agile; doesn't mention the weaknesses

2. "What is agile methodology?" on Infoworld: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3237508/what-is-agile-methodology-modern-software-development-explained.html
   - Some historical context and a "business case" for why Agile is better, in the author's opinion.
   - His usage of "Agile methodology" *contradicts* what is on agilealliance.org.
