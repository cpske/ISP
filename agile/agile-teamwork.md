A team member opens a Pull Request, but his/her code contains an obvious error.
How should we handle this?

1. **Prompt and direct feedback** 
   - **Code Review**: The PR should be reviewed promptly by one or more team members. In their review comments, they should clearly and respectfully point out the error and explain why it’s an issue, offering suggestions for improvement.
   - Deliver feedback in a positive way that encourages learning. For example, “I noticed this logic might lead to [specific problem]. How about refactoring it like this..."    
     "Since this is an important feature, how about writing unit tests to verify that this problem is fixed and ensure it doesn't reoccur?”
   
2. **Collaborative review**
   - Pair the team member with another developer to go through the PR together. This can turn the error into a teaching moment.

3. **Focus on the process, not the individual**
   - Errors are part of the development process, and Agile teams emphasize continuous improvement. The focus should be on fixing the issue and improving the team's workflow, not on blaming the individual.

4. **Review the testing or code review process**.
   - Could better tests have caught the error? Are code reviews done frequently enough?

4. **Learning opportunity** 
   - If this type of error has come up before, the team might consider addressing it during a retrospective. This could lead to process changes, such as improving test coverage, setting clearer code quality standards, or encouraging better communication about technical challenges.

5. **Reinforce a culture of accountability** 
   - Encourage the team to treat errors as learning opportunities. The person who made the mistake should take responsibility for fixing the issue, but they should also feel supported by the team.


Building an Effective Team

Watts Humphrey wrote that "*Effective teams don't just happen*". It requires communication.

1. **Collective Team Agreement**
   - Collectively agree on working practices, the shared goal, and level of effort to achieve it.  Set clear expectations.
2. **Reinforce Agile Principles**
   - Emphasize importance of collaboration, communication, daily meetings as a way to share information, and transparency.
