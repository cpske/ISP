_INVEST_:
* Independent - described independently of other user stories
* Negotiable - the features are the result of negotiation
* Valuable - add value to the product (as determined by P.O.)
* Estimable - user story described in a way that team can estimate effort to do it
* Small - describes a single interaction or specific functionality, not a big category of function
* Testable - can be tested as correct or not

## How to Perform Estimation in a Group

1. Story Card is read and asked if everyone understands it.  Team asks for claraification, if needed. 
2. Everyone submits an estimate (w/o knowing the others' estimates).
3. Estimates are written on a scale.  If all the same, then done.
4. High and Low estimates explain reason for their estimate.  Maybe they have different assumptions or understanding.  Maybe someone sees some complexity that others didn't think of.  Some discussion may ensue.
5. Repeat 2 - 4.
