## Three Pillars of Scrum

Important characteristics of Scrum:

* **Transparency** - the process and progress are visible to those affected by the outcome. For example, a shared definition for when something is "done"
* **Inspection** - frequently inspect artifacts and progress toward the Sprint goal. 
* **Adaptation** - when a product or process is deviating from target, the process or the work products must be adjusted. Adjustment should be done as soon as possible.
