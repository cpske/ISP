Using Iterative and Incremental development, teams create software in **time-boxed** iterations.  How do you plan and manage the work done in iterations?  Scrum is a popular technique for planning, do, and tracking your progress.
It can be used with many iterative processes.

To learn about Scrum,

1. Watch [Scrum in Under 10 Minutes (video)](https://youtu.be/XU0llRltyFM) a good introduction - but you need to know more than just this.
2. Read the official [Scrum Guide][Scrum Guide] (English or Thai) by the creators of Scrum.
   - Downloadable [Thai translation](https://scrumguides.org/download.html) as PDF.

The official [Scrum Guide][Scrum Guide] is a bit dense.  Two other excellent docs are:
- [Comprehensive Scrum Guide](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum/) by Visual Paradigm.  A single (long) page with many illustrations.
- More detailed [Scrum Primer](/ISP/resources/Scrum-Primer.pdf) 20-page decription of Scrum. Really excellent!
- *Head First Agile* chapter [Project Management with Scrum](/ISP/resources/Head-First-Scrum.pdf). Memorable, entertaining, examples, & lots of questions (with answers).

Then answer these [Questions about Scrum](https://forms.gle/Cg4JxJZvkAxD3kiU6) 

## Scrum Key Values

> Values guide behavior and decisions.    
> Understanding the **values** and principles underlying a process will help 
> you make better decisions, esp. in an unfamiliar or challenging situation.

The 5 key values of Scrum are

* Commitment
* Courage
* Focus

What do these values mean?    
Good answers here:

* [Scrum Values](https://www.scrumalliance.org/about-scrum/values) from ScrumAlliance.org
* [Scrum Tutorial: Values](https://www.knowledgehut.com/tutorials/scrum-tutorial/scrum-values)
* [Scrum for Dummies: Values](https://www.dummies.com/careers/project-management/the-5-scrum-values/)
* *Managing Projects with Scrum* (Head First) in [Resources](#resources-to-learn-more).

## Three Pillars of Scrum

* **Transparency** - the process and progress are visible to those affected by the outcome. For example, a shared definition for when something is "done"

* **Inspection** - frequently inspect artifacts and progress toward the Sprint goal. 

* **Adaptation** - when a product or process is deviating from target, the process or the work products must be adjusted. Adjustment should be done as soon as possible.
